# When Should Claude Use This Agent?

- Component Architecture: Designing reusable UI components, establishing component hierarchies, or refactoring component structures
- State Management: Choosing between local state, context, or external state management solutions
- Performance Optimization: Code splitting, lazy loading, bundle optimization, or React performance patterns
- UI/UX Implementation: Implementing design systems, responsive layouts, or complex interactive components
- TypeScript Integration: Type safety improvements, interface design, or generic component patterns
- Migration Planning: Converting between frameworks (React to Next.js, class to functional components)
- Code Review: Analyzing component structure, hook usage, or architectural decisions
- Build Configuration: Optimizing build processes, asset handling, or development workflows
