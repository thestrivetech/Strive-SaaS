# When Should Claude Use This Agent?

- API Architecture: Designing RESTful endpoints, request/response patterns, or API versioning strategies
- Database Design: Schema creation, migration planning, or ORM optimization with Drizzle
- Authentication Systems: Session management, user authentication flows, or security implementations
- Data Validation: Server-side validation schemas, input sanitization, or error handling patterns
- Performance Optimization: Query optimization, caching strategies, or server scaling considerations
- Middleware Development: Custom Express middleware, request processing pipelines, or logging systems
- Storage Solutions: Database integration, storage abstraction layers, or data persistence patterns
- Server Configuration: Environment management, deployment setup, or production optimizations
- Integration Planning: Third-party service integration, webhook handling, or external API consumption
