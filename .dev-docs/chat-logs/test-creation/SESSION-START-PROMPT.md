# Session 4 Start Prompt: Test Suite Implementation

Read these files to begin:
- `/Users/grant/Documents/GitHub/Strive-SaaS/CLAUDE.md` (project standards)
- `/Users/grant/Documents/GitHub/Strive-SaaS/README.md` (architecture overview)
- `/Users/grant/Documents/GitHub/Strive-SaaS/chat-logs/test-creation/session2.md` (session todo list)

**Task:** Implement comprehensive test suite for Strive Tech SaaS platform.

**Goal:** 80%+ test coverage with automated CI/CD pipeline.

**Approach:**
1. Follow session4.md todo list sequentially
2. Use TodoWrite tool to track progress through all phases
3. Mark tasks complete as you finish them
4. Follow TDD approach (write tests first)
5. Run tests frequently to verify progress

**Critical reminders:**
- Use Read tool before editing any files
- Check for existing test utilities with Glob/Grep first
- Server Components by default (no "use client" unless needed)
- All Server Actions must have 100% test coverage
- Files under 500 lines (hard limit)
- Clean database between tests (beforeEach/afterEach)

**Start with Phase 1, Task 1.1** from session4.md and work through each phase systematically.
