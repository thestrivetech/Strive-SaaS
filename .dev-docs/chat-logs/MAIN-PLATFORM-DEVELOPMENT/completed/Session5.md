## üéØ Session 5 Primary Objectives

### Priority 1: Complete CRM CRUD Operations
**Finish the Customer Management system**

#### 1. Customer Detail Page
**File:** `app/(platform)/crm/[customerId]/page.tsx`
- Create dynamic route for individual customers
- Display full customer information:
  - Contact details (name, email, phone, company)
  - Status and source badges
  - Assigned team member
  - Created/updated timestamps
- Show related data:
  - Associated projects list
  - Upcoming appointments
  - Activity timeline from ActivityLog
- Add edit and delete buttons in header
- Add "Back to CRM" navigation

**Why Server Component:**
- Fetch customer data on server
- SEO-friendly for customer profiles
- Faster initial load with RSC

#### 2. Customer Edit Dialog
**File:** `app/components/features/crm/edit-customer-dialog.tsx`
- Reuse CreateCustomerDialog structure
- Pre-populate form with existing customer data
- Connect to updateCustomer server action
- Handle optimistic UI updates
- Show success/error toasts
- Auto-refresh parent page

**Pattern:**
```typescript
<EditCustomerDialog
  customer={existingCustomer}
  organizationId={orgId}
/>
```

#### 3. Customer Delete Confirmation
**File:** `app/components/features/crm/delete-customer-dialog.tsx`
- Create confirmation dialog with warning
- Show customer name to confirm intent
- Connect to deleteCustomer server action
- Handle cascade implications (projects, appointments)
- Show toast on success/failure
- Redirect to CRM list after delete

**Pattern:**
```typescript
<AlertDialog>
  <AlertDialogTrigger>Delete</AlertDialogTrigger>
  <AlertDialogContent>
    <AlertDialogTitle>Delete Customer?</AlertDialogTitle>
    <AlertDialogDescription>
      This will permanently delete {customer.name} and all associated data.
    </AlertDialogDescription>
    {/* Delete button with action */}
  </AlertDialogContent>
</AlertDialog>
```

#### 4. Connect Dropdown Menu Actions
**File:** `app/(platform)/crm/page.tsx` (existing)
- Make dropdown items functional:
  - "View details" ‚Üí Navigate to `/crm/[id]`
  - "Edit customer" ‚Üí Open EditCustomerDialog
  - "Delete customer" ‚Üí Open DeleteCustomerDialog
- Add loading states during actions
- Handle errors gracefully

---

### Priority 2: CRM Search & Filter
**Add search and filtering capabilities**

#### 1. Search Input Component
**File:** `app/components/features/crm/customer-search.tsx` (client component)
- Debounced search input (300ms delay)
- Search by: name, email, company
- Clear button when text entered
- Show search icon
- Connect to URL search params

**Why Client Component:**
- Needs useState for debouncing
- Interactive typing experience
- Updates URL params for sharing

#### 2. Filter Dropdowns
**File:** `app/components/features/crm/customer-filters.tsx` (client component)
- Status filter (Lead, Prospect, Active, Churned, All)
- Source filter (Website, Referral, Social, Email, Other, All)
- Assigned To filter (team members dropdown)
- Clear all filters button
- Connect to URL search params

#### 3. Update CRM Page with Filters
**File:** `app/(platform)/crm/page.tsx` (modify existing)
- Read search params from URL
- Pass filters to getCustomers query
- Add CustomerSearch and CustomerFilters components
- Show active filter badges
- Maintain filters across page refreshes

**Pattern:**
```typescript
export default async function CRMPage({ searchParams }) {
  const filters = {
    search: searchParams.search,
    status: searchParams.status,
    source: searchParams.source,
  };
  const customers = await getCustomers(orgId, filters);
  // ...
}
```

---

### Priority 3: Organization Context Switching
**Enable multi-organization switching**

#### 1. Organization Context Cookie
**File:** `app/lib/modules/organization/context.ts`
- Create helper functions:
  - `setCurrentOrganization(orgId)` - Set cookie
  - `getCurrentOrganization(userId)` - Get from cookie or default
- Cookie config:
  - httpOnly: false (need client access)
  - secure: true (HTTPS only in prod)
  - sameSite: 'lax'
  - maxAge: 30 days

#### 2. Update OrganizationSwitcher
**File:** `app/components/features/organization/organization-switcher.tsx`
- Connect to setCurrentOrganization action
- Show loading state during switch
- Refresh page after switch (router.refresh())
- Update UI to show current org from cookie

#### 3. Update All Queries to Use Context
**Files:** All pages with org queries
- Dashboard: Use org from context
- CRM: Use org from context
- Settings: Use org from context
- Projects: Use org from context (when implemented)

**Helper Function:**
```typescript
async function getActiveOrganization(userId: string) {
  const orgId = getCurrentOrganization(userId);
  if (orgId) {
    return await getOrganization(orgId);
  }
  // Fallback to first org
  const userOrgs = await getUserOrganizations(userId);
  return userOrgs[0]?.organization;
}
```
