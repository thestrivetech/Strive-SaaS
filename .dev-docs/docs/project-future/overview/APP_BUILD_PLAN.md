# SaaS Application Build Plan

**Project:** Strive Tech SaaS Platform (app.strivetech.ai)
**Framework:** Next.js 15 + App Router
**Status:** ðŸš§ In Progress

---

## Architecture Overview

### Deployment Structure
- **Marketing Site:** `strivetech.ai` (existing React site in `app/web/` - legacy, not actively developed)
- **SaaS Platform:** `app.strivetech.ai` (new Next.js 15 app in `app/`)
  - Contains: Admin dashboard, client portal, employee workspace, CRM, projects, AI tools

### Authentication
- Shared auth via cookies (domain: `.strivetech.ai`)
- Login/signup on marketing site â†’ redirects to app
- App validates JWT from marketing site

### Databases
- **Existing DB:** Marketing site (contact forms, analytics) - UNCHANGED
- **New DB:** SaaS platform (organizations, projects, CRM, AI tools)
- User sync on signup between both databases

### Multiple Dashboard Types Within the APP
The `app/` directory contains multiple dashboard experiences within the application:
- **Admin Dashboard:** Full system access, user management, analytics
- **Employee Dashboard:** Project management, CRM, time tracking
- **Client Portal:** Project visibility, communication, invoices
- All share the same database and infrastructure but have role-based views

### Design System
- Reuse shadcn/ui components from `app/web/client/src/components/ui/`
- Maintain consistent UI/UX with marketing site
- Add new app-specific components as needed (dashboards, CRM, project views)

## Key Decisions & Notes

### Why Separate Next.js App in `app/` directory?
- Zero risk to production marketing site
- Independent deployment and scaling
- Clear separation of concerns (marketing vs. application)
- Easier to develop and test in isolation
- Semantic naming: `app/` = SaaS application, not just "a dashboard"
- Contains multiple dashboard types (admin, employee, client)
- Future-proof for monorepo structure (web/ and app/)

### Why Keep Marketing Site Separate?
- Already production-ready and stable
- Legacy React app (not actively developed)
- Focus on building new Next.js app features
- Clean separation between marketing and SaaS platform

### Why Dual Databases?
- Marketing DB has existing data (forms, analytics)
- SaaS DB needs complex schema (multi-tenant, CRM, etc.)
- Clean separation of concerns
- User records synced on authentication

### Why Subdomain Strategy?
- Clean URL structure (`app.` prefix = dashboard)
- Cookie sharing for seamless auth (`.strivetech.ai` domain)
- Independent DNS and deployment config
- Professional appearance for SaaS product
