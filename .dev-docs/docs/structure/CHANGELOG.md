## 2025-10-03 - Update 2: Data Organization Cleanup ✅

**What Changed:**
- Moved `data/portfolio/` → `data/(web)/portfolio/`
- Moved `data/resources/` → `data/(web)/resources/`

**Impact:**
- ✅ All marketing/web data now properly organized under `data/(web)/`
- ✅ Clear separation between platform data and marketing data
- ✅ Consistent route group pattern across all directories

**Structure After Changes:**
```
data/
├── (chatbot)/              # Empty, ready for chatbot-specific data
├── (platform)/             # Platform-specific data
│   ├── industries/         # Empty, ready for industry data
│   └── shared/             # Empty, ready for shared platform data
└── (web)/                  # ✅ Marketing data (UPDATED)

## 2025-10-03 - Update 1: Initial Route Group Structure ✅

**What Changed:**
- Created route group structure for `components/`
- Created route group structure for `data/`
- Organized components by context: `(chatbot)`, `(platform)`, `(web)`

**Structure Created:**
```
components/
├── (chatbot)/              # NEW: Chatbot components
├── (platform)/             # NEW: Platform components
│   ├── shared/
│   ├── projects/
│   ├── real-estate/        # Industry-specific
│   │   ├── crm/           (7 files)
│   │   └── tasks/         (7 files)
│   ├── healthcare/         # Industry placeholder
│   └── legal/              # Industry placeholder
└── (web)/                  # NEW: Marketing components
    ├── about/
    ├── contact/
    ├── features/
    ├── solutions/
    ├── ui/                 # ⚠️ Should be at root
    └── ...

data/
├── (chatbot)/              # NEW: Chatbot data
├── (platform)/             # NEW: Platform data
│   ├── industries/
│   └── shared/
└── (web)/                  # NEW: Marketing data
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Clear context boundaries
- ✅ Mirrors app router structure
- ✅ Industry-specific components co-located
- ⚠️ UI components in wrong location (needs fix)

## 2025-10-03 - Session 1: Industry Foundation Created ✅

**What Was Created:**
- `lib/industries/_core/` - Base abstractions (4 files)
- `lib/industries/registry.ts` - Central registry
- `lib/industries/healthcare/` - Healthcare industry skeleton
- `lib/industries/real-estate/` - Real estate industry skeleton
- Prisma schema updates (Industry enum, Organization.industry field)
- Tests for industry system (3 test files)

**Total:** 21 new files, ~1,920 lines of code

**Documentation:**
- [x] SESSION1-COMPLETE.md - Full session summary

## 2025-10-03 - Update 3: Shared Components Decision ✅

**What Changed:**
- **Decision made:** Use `components/(shared)/` route group for shared components
- Provides explicit shared context accessible to all apps (web, platform, chatbot)

**Why This Decision:**
- ✅ Consistent with route group pattern
- ✅ Clear separation: shared vs context-specific
- ✅ Explicit intent (better than root-level `ui/`)
- ✅ Scalable for future shared components

**Structure:**
```
components/
├── (shared)/               # ✅ NEW: Shared across ALL apps
│   ├── ui/                 # shadcn/ui components
│   └── [other shared]      # Future shared components
├── (chatbot)/
├── (platform)/
└── (web)/
```

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Create `components/(shared)/ui/` directory
- [ ] Move 66 files from `(web)/ui/` to `(shared)/ui/`
- [ ] Update ~358 import statements
- [ ] Verify build passes

---

## Still Pending

### Session 2: Shared Components Migration ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Create `components/(shared)/` directory
- [x] Move `components/(web)/ui/` → `components/(shared)/ui/` (66 files)

- [x] Verify build passes (0 new errors)
- [x] Documentation complete

### Session 3: Industry Overrides
- [ ] Create `lib/industries/real-estate/overrides/crm/`
