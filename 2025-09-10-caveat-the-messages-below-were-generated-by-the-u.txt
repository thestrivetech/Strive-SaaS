●User approved Claude's plan:
  ⎿  Session 26 Implementation Plan

     Based on my analysis of the Company and Contact pages, here's the detailed plan to complete all requested updates:

     Company Page Updates (client/src/pages/company.tsx)

     1. Replace Hero Section with Vision/Roadmap

     - Remove the current hero section (lines 47-134) that includes the animated background and stats
     - Move the "Our Vision Timeline" section (lines 245-339) to become the new hero
     - Styling changes:
       - Keep the gradient background and animations
       - Update the title to combine "OUR VISION" label with "Roadmap to the Future" 
       - Maintain responsive design for timeline on mobile/tablet

     2. Update "View Our Work" Button

     - Location: Bottom CTA section (line 488)
     - Changes needed:
       - Change from variant="outline" with white border to a more vibrant color scheme
       - Add gradient background similar to primary button but with different colors
       - Enhance hover effect with scale transformation and shadow

     3. Fix "OUR FOUNDATION" Section

     - Current issue: Section appears to be working but may need visual improvements
     - Updates:
       - Review spacing and alignment of Mission/Vision/Values cards
       - Ensure consistent card heights and padding
       - Verify hover effects are smooth and professional
       - Check responsive layout on mobile devices

     Contact Page Updates (client/src/pages/contact.tsx)

     1. Reorganize Form Fields

     - Move "Company Name" field (currently after email) to below phone number
     - Move "Company Size" dropdown to immediately follow Company Name
     - Result: Email → Phone → Company Name → Company Size → Message

     2. Make Company Name Optional

     - Remove the required attribute from Company Name input (line 144)
     - Update the label from "Company Name *" to "Company Name (Optional)"
     - Note: This change only applies to Contact page, not other forms

     3. Add "Coming Soon" Banner to Brochure Button

     - Current: Button text is "Download Solutions Brochure" (line 280)
     - Update: Add ComingSoonBadge component to the button text
     - Implementation: 
       - Import existing ComingSoonBadge component (already imported)
       - Integrate badge into button text with proper sizing
       - Adjust text size if needed to maintain visual balance

     Testing Requirements

     - Verify all changes work on desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports
     - Ensure form submission still works correctly with optional Company Name
     - Check that the Vision/Roadmap timeline displays properly as hero section
     - Confirm button hover effects and animations are smooth

     Files to Modify

     1. client/src/pages/company.tsx - 3 main changes
     2. client/src/pages/contact.tsx - 3 form-related changes

     All changes are straightforward UI updates that improve user experience and visual consistency.

● Perfect! The plan has been approved. Let me start implementing the Session 26 updates by first updating the Company page.
