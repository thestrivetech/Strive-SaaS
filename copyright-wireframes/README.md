## How to Use These Wireframes

1. **Review Content**: Each file contains all the text that appears on that page
2. **Edit Copy**: Make changes directly in the markdown files
3. **Track Changes**: Use version control or comments to track edits
4. **Maintain Structure**: Keep the hierarchical structure (headers, sections) intact for easy implementation

## Wireframe Structure

Each wireframe follows this structure:
```
# Page Title
URL: /page-url

## Navigation Bar
[All navigation items]

## Main Content Sections
### Section Title
[Section content]

## Footer
[Footer links and information]
```

## Content Types Included

- **Headers**: All page titles and section headings
- **Descriptions**: All paragraph text and explanations
- **CTAs**: Button text and links
- **Forms**: Field labels, placeholders, and validation messages
- **Lists**: Bullet points, features, benefits
- **Statistics**: Numbers, metrics, achievements
- **Modals**: Popup content and dialogs
- **Navigation**: Menu items and links
- **Legal**: Terms, policies, disclaimers

## Notes for Editing

1. **Preserve Formatting**: Maintain the markdown structure for clarity
2. **Be Consistent**: Keep tone and voice consistent across pages
3. **SEO Considerations**: Review headlines and descriptions for SEO
4. **CTA Clarity**: Ensure all calls-to-action are clear and compelling
5. **Legal Accuracy**: Have legal team review terms, privacy, and cookie policies

## Implementation Notes

After editing these wireframes:
1. Changes will need to be implemented in the actual website code
2. Some dynamic content (like form submissions) is represented statically here
3. Interactive elements (dropdowns, modals) are shown in their expanded state
4. Images are referenced but not shown - only their alt text is included
