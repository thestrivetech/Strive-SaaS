## üöÄ Go-Live

### Pre-Launch
- [ ] Final code review completed
- [ ] Security audit passed
- [ ] Performance testing passed
- [ ] Backup database before deployment
- [ ] Verify rollback plan ready

### Deployment Steps
1. [ ] Deploy database migrations: `npx prisma migrate deploy --schema=../shared/prisma/schema.prisma`
2. [ ] Deploy to Vercel: `vercel --prod`
3. [ ] Verify environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. [ ] Run post-deployment smoke tests (below)

- [ ] Authentication works: Login/logout
- [ ] Dashboard loads with correct user data
- [ ] Navigation to transactions works
- [ ] Tier gate shows for FREE/BASIC users
- [ ] PRO/ENTERPRISE users can access transactions
- [ ] API health check passes: `https://app.strivetech.ai/api/health`
- [ ] No errors in browser console
- [ ] No errors in Vercel logs (check first 10 minutes)

### Monitoring (First Hour)
- [ ] Error rate < 0.1% (Vercel Analytics)
- [ ] Average response time < 500ms

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

### If Critical Issues Occur:

#### Option 1: Feature Flag Disable
```bash
# Set environment variable in Vercel
ENABLE_TRANSACTIONS=false

# Redeploy
vercel --prod
```

#### Option 2: Database Rollback
```bash
# Identify migration to roll back
npx prisma migrate status --schema=../shared/prisma/schema.prisma

# Mark migration as rolled back
npx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back <migration-name> --schema=../shared/prisma/schema.prisma

# Deploy previous version
git revert HEAD
vercel --prod
```

#### Option 3: Partial Rollback
- Remove "Transactions" from navigation (hide feature)
- Keep backend active for existing data integrity
- Fix issues in staging
- Re-enable when stable

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Warnings

### DO NOT:
- ‚ùå Skip tier enforcement (leads to revenue loss)
- ‚ùå Deploy without testing RLS policies (data leak risk)
- ‚ùå Forget to configure email service (broken notification flow)
- ‚ùå Skip database backup before deployment
- ‚ùå Deploy with failing tests
- ‚ùå Commit `.env` or `.env.local` files
- ‚ùå Expose `DOCUMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` to client
- ‚ùå Allow direct database access without RLS

### MUST:
- ‚úÖ Test with multiple organizations
- ‚úÖ Verify all email notifications sending
- ‚úÖ Check Supabase storage bucket permissions
- ‚úÖ Monitor first 24 hours closely
- ‚úÖ Have rollback plan ready and tested
- ‚úÖ Backup encryption key securely (lost key = lost documents!)
- ‚úÖ Test subscription tier enforcement
- ‚úÖ Verify RBAC for all roles
