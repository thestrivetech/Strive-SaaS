## FLOW 8: MULTI-TENANCY TESTING

**Route:** Various (testing organization isolation)

### Test Steps

**IMPORTANT:** This flow requires ability to switch organizations. Since mock data uses `demo-org` for localhost bypass, true multi-tenancy testing requires either:
1. Disabling localhost bypass temporarily
2. Creating second mock organization
3. Using browser dev tools to modify session data

**For Code Review (without switching orgs):**

#### Step 8.1: Verify Organization Filtering in Code
- [ ] Review: `lib/modules/marketplace/queries.ts`
- [ ] Verify: All queries include `organizationId` filter
- [ ] Example: `getPurchasedTools()` filters by current user's org
- [ ] Verify: No raw queries without org filter

**Expected Result:** ✅ Organization isolation in code

#### Step 8.2: Verify Purchase Isolation
- [ ] Review: `lib/modules/marketplace/actions.ts`
- [ ] Verify: `purchaseTool()` includes `organizationId` in create
- [ ] Verify: Purchases are scoped to organization
- [ ] Review mock data: `lib/data/providers/marketplace-provider.ts`
- [ ] Verify: `purchasesProvider.findMany(orgId)` filters by org

**Expected Result:** ✅ Purchases isolated by organization

#### Step 8.3: Verify Cart Isolation
- [ ] Review: `lib/modules/marketplace/cart/actions.ts`
- [ ] Verify: Cart is scoped to user (not org)
- [ ] Verify: `getShoppingCart(userId)` uses userId
- [ ] Note: Carts are per-user, not per-org (expected behavior)

**Expected Result:** ✅ Carts isolated by user

#### Step 8.4: Verify Review Visibility
- [ ] Review: `lib/modules/marketplace/reviews/queries.ts`
- [ ] Verify: `getToolReviews()` returns ALL reviews (cross-org)
- [ ] Rationale: Reviews should be visible across organizations
- [ ] Verify: `createToolReview()` includes `organizationId` for audit
- [ ] Verify: `hasUserPurchasedTool()` checks purchase in current org

**Expected Result:** ✅ Reviews visible cross-org, purchase checks per org

**For Manual Testing (if org switching implemented):**

#### Step 8.5: Purchase in Organization A
- [ ] Login as user in Organization A
- [ ] Purchase Tool 1, Tool 2, Tool 3
- [ ] Add review to Tool 1
- [ ] Add items to cart
- [ ] Note: organizationId = "demo-org" or "org-a"

#### Step 8.6: Switch to Organization B
- [ ] Switch to different organization (org-b)
- [ ] OR: Login as user in different org
- [ ] Navigate to marketplace

#### Step 8.7: Verify Isolation in Organization B
- [ ] Navigate to purchases page
- [ ] Verify: Purchases from Org A NOT visible
- [ ] Verify: Stats show 0 active tools (if no purchases in Org B)
- [ ] Check cart
- [ ] Verify: Cart from Org A NOT visible (user's cart might be empty or different)
- [ ] Navigate to Tool 1 detail page
- [ ] Verify: Can view Tool 1 reviews (cross-org)
- [ ] Verify: Cannot write review (didn't purchase in this org)
- [ ] Verify: "Purchase this tool to review" message

#### Step 8.8: Purchase Same Tool in Organization B
- [ ] In Organization B, add Tool 1 to cart
- [ ] Verify: No "already purchased" error (different org)
- [ ] Complete purchase
- [ ] Verify: Purchase succeeds
- [ ] Verify: Can now write review for Tool 1 from Org B
- [ ] Verify: Org A's purchase of Tool 1 is NOT visible in Org B

**Expected Result:** ✅ Complete organization isolation
