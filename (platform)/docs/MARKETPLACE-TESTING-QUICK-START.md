## QUESTIONS?

### Common Questions

**Q: What if mock data doesn't load?**
A: Check `.env.local` has `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCKS=true`. Restart dev server.

**Q: What if cart doesn't persist?**
A: Mock cart is in-memory only. Will reset on server restart. Expected behavior.

**Q: Can I test with real database?**
A: Not yet. Schema is minimal (3 models). Marketplace tables not migrated. Use mocks only.

**Q: How do I test multi-tenancy?**
A: Currently requires code review (Flow 8). Real org switching not implemented in mocks yet.

**Q: What if I find a critical bug?**
A: Document in test report as P0. Note in console. Take screenshot. Report immediately.
