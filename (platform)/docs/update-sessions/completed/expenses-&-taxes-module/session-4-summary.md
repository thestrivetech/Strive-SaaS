## Key Implementations

### Tax Calculation Engine
**2025 Tax Brackets (Progressive):**
- 10% on income up to $11,600
- 12% on income $11,600 - $47,150
- 22% on income $47,150 - $100,525
- 24% on income $100,525 - $191,950
- 32% on income $191,950 - $243,725
- 35% on income $243,725 - $609,350
- 37% on income over $609,350

**Standard Deduction:** $14,600 (2025 single filer)

**Calculation Flow:**
1. Aggregate deductible expenses from database
2. Calculate total deductions (business + standard)
3. Calculate taxable income (income - deductions)
4. Apply progressive tax brackets
5. Calculate effective tax rate

### Expense Report Generation
**Features:**
- Date range filtering
- Category filtering
- Property filtering
- Merchant filtering
- Expense aggregation
- Summary statistics
- JSON report data storage

**Report Structure:**
```typescript
{
  expenses: [
    {
      id, date, merchant, category, amount,
      isDeductible, propertyAddress, createdBy
    }
  ],
  summary: {
    totalExpenses,
    totalDeductible,
    count,
    deductibleCount
  }
}
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/expenses/tax-estimate?year=2025` - Generate tax estimate
- `GET /api/v1/expenses/reports` - List reports
- `POST /api/v1/expenses/reports` - Create report

---

## Security Implementation

### Multi-Tenancy
- âœ… All queries filtered by `organizationId`
- âœ… No cross-organization data leakage
- âœ… Ownership verification before updates/deletes
- âœ… Organization context enforced in all actions

### RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
- âœ… `canAccessExpenses()` helper used in all actions
- âœ… Permission checks before all operations
- âœ… Proper error messages for unauthorized access
- âœ… Dual-role system ready (GlobalRole + OrganizationRole)

### Input Validation
- âœ… Zod schemas for all user inputs
- âœ… Tax estimate: year (2020-2050), quarter (1-4), rates (0-1)
- âœ… Amounts: nonnegative validation
- âœ… Date ranges: startDate â‰¤ endDate validation
- âœ… Runtime validation before database operations

### Tier Enforcement
- âœ… Expenses module requires STARTER tier minimum ($299/seat)
- âœ… Feature access validated in RBAC helper
- âœ… Ready for tier-based limits

### Decimal Precision
- âœ… Proper handling of Decimal types from Prisma
- âœ… Number() conversion for calculations
- âœ… No rounding errors in tax calculations

---

## Database Models Used

### tax_estimates
- Fields: year, quarter, income fields, deduction fields, tax calculations
