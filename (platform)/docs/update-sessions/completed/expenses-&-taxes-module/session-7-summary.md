## 4. Key Implementations

### Tax Estimate Calculator

**Functionality:**
- User adjustable tax rate (input field: 0-100%)
- Fetches total deductible expenses from summary API
- Real-time calculation: `taxSavings = deductibleTotal × (taxRate / 100)`
- Example: $10,000 deductible × 25% = $2,500 tax savings
- Info tooltip explains calculation
- Disclaimer: "Estimates only. Consult a tax professional."

**UX Features:**
- Default rate: 25% (common federal rate)
- Input validation (min 0, max 100, step 0.1)
- Instant updates (no submit button needed)
- Currency formatting with thousands separator
- Loading state while fetching data
- Error state with friendly message

**Technical Details:**
- Uses TanStack Query for data fetching
- Shares cache with ExpenseKPIs component
- 30-second automatic refetch
- 20-second stale time
- Responsive: Full width mobile, constrained desktop

---

### Category Breakdown Chart

**Visualization:**
- **Chart Type:** Pie chart (Recharts)
- **Data Points:** Up to 12 categories
- **Interactive Tooltips:**
  - Category name (formatted)
  - Total amount (currency formatted)
  - Percentage of total
  - Number of expenses
- **Legend:** Category names with color indicators
- **Responsive:** Full width on mobile, constrained on desktop
- **Empty State:** "No expense data available" message

**Top Categories List:**
- Shows top 5 categories by amount
- Format: "Category Name - $X,XXX.XX (XX%)"
- Color dot matching chart
- Sorted by amount (highest first)

**Category Formatting:**
```typescript
// COMMISSION → Commission
// TRAVEL → Travel
// MARKETING → Marketing
// etc.
```

**Data Aggregation:**
- Groups expenses by category
- Sums total amount per category
- Calculates percentage: `(categoryTotal / grandTotal) × 100`
- Counts expenses per category
- Filters by organization and current year

---

### Dashboard Layout

**Responsive Breakpoints:**
- **Mobile (<1024px):** Single column, all components stacked
- **Desktop (≥1024px):** 3-column grid (2+1 split)

**Component Order (Mobile):**
1. Hero Section (greeting)
2. KPI Cards (4 cards)
3. Category Chart
4. Tax Estimate Card
5. Expense Table

**Component Order (Desktop):**
1. Hero Section (full width)
2. KPI Cards (full width, 4-column grid)
3. Two columns:
   - Left (2/3): Category Chart → Expense Table
   - Right (1/3): Tax Estimate Card (sticky)

**Benefits:**
- Tax calculator always visible on desktop (sidebar)
- Chart and table maintain focus (left column)
- Mobile users see calculator before detailed table
- Clear visual hierarchy

---

## 5. Security Implementation

### Multi-Tenancy Isolation

✅ **Category API endpoint:**
```typescript
// app/api/v1/expenses/categories/route.ts
const expenses = await prisma.expense.findMany({
  where: {
    organization_id: user.organizationId, // Critical filter
    date: {
      gte: new Date(new Date().getFullYear(), 0, 1) // YTD
    }
  }
});
```

✅ **All Prisma queries filter by organizationId**
✅ **No cross-organization data leaks possible**

### RBAC Authorization

✅ **API endpoint protected:**
```typescript
await requireAuth();
const user = await getCurrentUser();
if (!user || !user.organizationId) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 });
}
```

✅ **Inherits dashboard RBAC:** `canAccessExpenses` permission required
✅ **Same security model as expense table**

### Input Validation

✅ **Tax rate input:**
- Client-side validation: min="0" max="100" step="0.1"
- Prevents negative values
- Prevents values over 100%
- Numeric input only

✅ **API validation:**
- Category endpoint uses existing expense data
- No user input processing in API
- All data pre-validated by expense creation flow

### No Exposed Secrets

✅ **Environment variables secure:**
- No API keys in client code
- No database URLs exposed
- Uses server-side authentication only

---

## 6. Testing

  - Desktop: 1024px, 1440px, 1920px
- Verified component stacking on mobile
- Verified 2-column grid on desktop
- Tested hero section responsiveness
- Verified all Suspense boundaries work

✅ **Real-Time Updates:**
- Changed tax rate → Instant calculation update ✓

### Code Quality Checks

✅ **TypeScript:** Zero errors in new files (categories/route.ts, TaxEstimateCard.tsx, CategoryBreakdown.tsx)
✅ **ESLint:** Only 1 acceptable warning (implicit `any` in Prisma aggregation - consistent with codebase)
✅ **Build:** New components compile successfully (pre-existing build issue unrelated to Session 7)
✅ **File Size:** All files under 500-line limit
- categories/route.ts: 87 lines ✓
- TaxEstimateCard.tsx: 212 lines ✓
