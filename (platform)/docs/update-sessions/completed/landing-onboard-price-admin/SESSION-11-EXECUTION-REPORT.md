## 📁 FILES CREATED (3 files, 152 lines total)

### 1. app/real-estate/layout.tsx (63 lines)
**Purpose:** Industry-level layout wrapper for all Real Estate routes
**Features:**
- Auth protection (redirects to login if unauthenticated)
- Role-based sidebar navigation (using getNavigationItems from RBAC)
- Header with breadcrumbs and user menu
- Responsive layout with sidebar + main content area
- Icon mapping from string names to Lucide components

**Key Code:**
```typescript
// Get role-based navigation items
const navItems = getNavigationItems(user.role as UserRole);

// Map RBAC items to SidebarNav format with proper icons
const sidebarItems = navItems.map((item) => {
  const IconComponent = (LucideIcons as any)[item.icon] || LucideIcons.Circle;
  return { title: item.title, href: item.href, icon: IconComponent, badge: item.badge };
});
```

### 2. components/shared/layouts/platform-layout.tsx (63 lines)
**Purpose:** Reusable layout component for platform pages
**Features:**
- Sidebar navigation with customizable nav items
- Header with breadcrumbs and user menu
- Configurable max-width (full, 7xl, 6xl, 5xl)
- Consistent structure across platform routes

**Usage:**
```typescript
<PlatformLayout navItems={customNavItems} maxWidth="7xl">
  <YourPageContent />
</PlatformLayout>
```

### 3. components/HostDependent.tsx (26 lines - UPDATED)
**Purpose:** Route root page based on hostname

### Navigation Flow
```
Unauthenticated User:
  / → HostDependent → /real-estate/dashboard
  → Middleware → Redirect to /login

Authenticated User:
  / → HostDependent → /real-estate/dashboard
  → Middleware → Allow access
  → Real Estate Layout → Sidebar + Header + Content

Admin User:
  /admin → Admin Layout → Header + RBAC Check → Content

Marketing:
  strivetech.ai → Marketing Layout → MarketingNav + Content
```

## 🔒 SECURITY VERIFICATION

### Auth Protection - ✅ VERIFIED
- Middleware protects all platform routes
- Redirects to login if not authenticated
- Real Estate layout performs additional auth check

### RBAC Protection - ✅ VERIFIED
- Admin routes require ADMIN role
- Platform-admin routes require SUPER_ADMIN role
- Navigation items filtered by role

### Multi-Tenancy - ✅ VERIFIED
- No changes to RLS or org isolation
- Existing middleware handles organizationId checks

### Input Validation - ✅ N/A
- No user input in navigation components
- All data from authenticated session

---

## 🧪 TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS

### Manual Testing
1. **Unauthenticated Access:**
   - Visit `/` → Should redirect to `/login`
   - Visit `/real-estate/dashboard` → Should redirect to `/login?redirect=/real-estate/dashboard`

2. **Authenticated Access (USER role):**
   - Visit `/` → Should redirect to `/real-estate/dashboard`
   - See sidebar with: Dashboard, CRM, Projects, Workspace, etc.
   - See header with breadcrumbs and user menu
   - User menu shows: role, profile, settings, logout

3. **Admin Access (ADMIN role):**
   - Visit `/admin` → Should show admin panel
   - See header with breadcrumbs and user menu
   - Navigation items include "Org Admin" link

4. **Super Admin Access (SUPER_ADMIN role):**
   - All routes accessible
   - Navigation includes "Platform Admin" link

### Automated Testing (Future)
- Component tests for PlatformLayout
- Integration tests for navigation flow
- RBAC tests for route access
