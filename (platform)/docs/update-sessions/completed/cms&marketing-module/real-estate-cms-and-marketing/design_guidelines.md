# Content Management & Marketing Dashboard - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach: Design System Foundation

**Selected System:** shadcn/ui + Linear-inspired Aesthetic
**Justification:** This is a utility-focused productivity tool for professional real estate agents requiring efficiency, clarity, and information density. We'll build on shadcn/ui's component architecture while drawing inspiration from Linear's clean, modern interface patterns and Notion's content management UI for intuitive workflows.

**Core Design Principles:**
- Information clarity over decoration
- Progressive disclosure for complex features
- Consistent, predictable interactions
- Professional polish with subtle refinement
- Data-dense layouts with breathing room

## Images & Visual Assets

**Icon Strategy:** Use Lucide React (via shadcn/ui) exclusively for all icons - consistent stroke-width of 2; size-4 (16px) for inline icons, size-5 (20px) for buttons, size-6 (24px) for headers

**Photographic Assets:**
- **Dashboard Hero (If Applicable):** No hero image - dashboards prioritize data visibility
- **Campaign Thumbnails:** 16:9 aspect ratio placeholders; use subtle gradient overlays (primary color at 10% opacity) on empty states
- **Agent Profile Photos:** Circular avatars; 40px in navigation, 80px in cards, 120px in detailed views
- **Property Listings (Real Estate Blocks):** 4:3 aspect ratio; contain multiple images in carousel format; overlay property price in bottom-left with frosted glass background

**Placeholder Content:**
- Sample campaign images: Use Unsplash API for real estate photography
- Chart data: Realistic metrics (open rates 20-35%, CTR 2-5%, social engagement 3-8%)
- Agent names: Diverse, professional names with varied geographic markets

---

**Animation Philosophy:** Minimal and purposeful
- Page transitions: Fade-in content (200ms)
- Micro-interactions: Scale buttons on press (95%), subtle shadow elevation on card hover
- Data loading: Skeleton screens with pulse animation; chart data animates in on mount (400ms ease-out)
- Drag-and-drop: Smooth transform with 150ms transition; drop zones pulse with primary color at mount

This design system creates a professional, data-rich environment where real estate agents can efficiently manage marketing campaigns while maintaining visual clarity and modern polish.
