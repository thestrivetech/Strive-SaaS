**Key Weaknesses:**
- Zero test coverage (CRITICAL)
- 52 unused components (17% dead code)
- Missing production features (tier gate, error boundaries)
- Large files need splitting

**Recommended Focus:**
1. **Week 1:** Critical fixes (tier gate, error boundaries, tests)
2. **Week 2:** Cleanup (delete unused, fix duplicates)
3. **Week 3:** Refactoring (split large files)
4. **Ongoing:** Test coverage (target 80%)

The platform is **ready for continued development** but needs **test coverage** and **cleanup** before production deployment.
