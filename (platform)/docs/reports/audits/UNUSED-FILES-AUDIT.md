- `/api/v1/ai-garage/orders/route.ts` - ‚úÖ KEEP (marketplace backend exists)
- `/api/v1/ai-garage/templates/route.ts` - ‚úÖ KEEP

**CRM Routes** (1):
- `/api/v1/leads/route.ts` - ‚úÖ KEEP (CRM leads page uses mock data, API may be unused)

**Webhooks** (1):
- `/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` - ‚úÖ KEEP (payment processing)

**Health Check** (1):
- `/api/health/route.ts` - ‚úÖ KEEP (system monitoring)

---

### 6.2 API Routes Recommendations

**KEEP (29 routes):**
- All auth, onboarding, admin, dashboard, marketplace, webhooks, health routes
- Evidence of active usage via fetch calls in components/pages

**REVIEW (4 routes):**
- Expense API routes (`/api/v1/expenses/*`)
- **Rationale:** Frontend is skeleton, backend is implemented
- **Decision:** Keep if backend logic is valuable for future implementation
- **Conservative approach:** ‚úÖ KEEP (backend investment exists)

**REVIEW (1 route):**
- `/api/v1/leads/route.ts`
- **Rationale:** CRM uses mock data providers, may not call this API
- **Action:** Check if Server Actions replaced this API route
- **Conservative approach:** ‚úÖ KEEP (low cost, may be used in production mode)

**Final Recommendation:** ‚úÖ **KEEP ALL 33 API ROUTES**
- Most have clear usage evidence
- Expense routes support implemented backend
- Leads route may be for future real DB mode
- Low cost to maintain
- Risk of breaking features outweighs cleanup benefit

---

## 7. Test Files Analysis

### 7.1 Test Coverage

**Location:** `__tests__/` directory
**Total Test Files:** 61

**Categories:**

**API Tests** (`__tests__/api/`):
- Admin tests (3 files): audit-logs, organizations, users
- Webhook tests (1 file): stripe
- **Status:** ‚úÖ KEEP - Testing critical API endpoints

**Component Tests** (`__tests__/components/`):
- Admin components (3 files)
- Landing page components (4 files)
- Layouts (1 file)
- Onboarding (1 file)
- Pricing (3 files)
- Shared navigation (1 file)
- Providers (1 file)
- UI components (1 file: button)
- **Status:** ‚úÖ KEEP - Testing active components

**Database Tests** (`__tests__/database/`):
- Tenant isolation test
- **Status:** ‚úÖ KEEP - Critical multi-tenancy test

**Module Tests** (`__tests__/modules/`):
- **Expected:** Tests for modules in `lib/modules/`
- **Status:** Review test count vs module count

**Integration Tests** (`__tests__/integration/`):
- **Expected:** E2E workflow tests
- **Status:** Review existence

---

### 7.2 Orphaned Tests Analysis

**Question:** Are there tests for skeleton modules (ai-hub, rei-analytics)?

**Check Required:**
```bash
# Search for tests of skeleton modules
find __tests__ -name "*ai-hub*" -o -name "*rei-analytics*" 2>/dev/null
```

**Recommendation:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **DELETE** any tests for ai-hub and rei-analytics modules (if they exist)
- ‚úÖ **KEEP** all other tests (active features)

**Estimated Impact:**
- If skeleton module tests exist: Delete 0-10 test files
- Otherwise: ‚úÖ KEEP ALL 61 test files

---

## 8. Loading States & Skeletons

### 8.1 Loading Skeleton Files

**Pattern:** Multiple `loading.tsx` files with TODO comments

**Found Files:**
| File | Lines | TODOs | Status |
|------|-------|-------|--------|
| `app/real-estate/crm/*/loading.tsx` | 5 each | 1 each | ‚úÖ KEEP - Valid Next.js pattern |
| `app/real-estate/workspace/*/loading.tsx` | 5-28 | 1-4 | ‚úÖ KEEP - Valid Next.js pattern |

**Total:** ~15+ loading skeleton files

**Reasoning:**
- `loading.tsx` is a valid Next.js 15 App Router pattern
- Provides instant loading states during navigation
- TODO comments are notes for enhancement (add branded spinners, etc.)
- Not "unused" code - actively used by Next.js router

**Recommendation:** ‚úÖ **KEEP ALL** - Valid Next.js loading states

# 7. Check for missing components
npm run dev  # Start dev server and manually test navigation
```

---

## 12. Deletion Workflow

### Phase 1: High-Confidence Deletions (Low Risk)

**Target:** ai-hub and rei-analytics skeleton modules

```bash
# 1. Create backup branch
git checkout -b cleanup/remove-skeleton-modules
git branch backup/pre-cleanup-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# 2. Delete ai-hub module
rm -rf "app/real-estate/ai-hub"
rm -rf "lib/modules/ai-hub"

# 3. Delete rei-analytics module
rm -rf "app/real-estate/rei-analytics"
rm -rf "lib/modules/rei-analytics"

# 4. Search for any remaining references
grep -r "ai-hub\|ai_hub\|aiHub" app lib components prisma
grep -r "rei-analytics\|rei_analytics\|reiAnalytics" app lib components prisma

# 5. Remove imports (if any found)
# Edit files to remove broken imports

# 6. Run verification commands (see section 11)
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build

# 7. If all pass: Commit
git add -A
git commit -m "cleanup: remove skeleton modules (ai-hub, rei-analytics)

Removed:
- app/real-estate/ai-hub/ (3 files)
- lib/modules/ai-hub/ (4 files)
- app/real-estate/rei-analytics/ (3 files)
- lib/modules/rei-analytics/ (4 files)

Total: 14 files, ~434 lines

Rationale:
- < 5% implementation (TODO placeholders only)
- No database models in minimal schema
- Not needed for mock data UI development
- Can be recreated when features are prioritized

Verified:
‚úÖ TypeScript: 0 errors
‚úÖ Linting: 0 errors
‚úÖ Tests: All passing
‚úÖ Build: Successful
"

# 8. Test in dev mode
npm run dev
# Navigate to app and verify no broken routes
```

**Expected Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Type check: Should pass (no dependencies on these modules)
- ‚úÖ Linting: Should pass
- ‚úÖ Tests: Should pass (or delete orphaned tests)
- ‚úÖ Build: Should succeed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Routes: `/real-estate/ai-hub` and `/real-estate/rei-analytics` will 404
  - **Action:** Remove navigation links if they exist

---

### Phase 2: Medium-Confidence Deletions (Medium Risk)

**Target:** Frontend skeletons for expense-tax, cms-marketing, marketplace

**Prerequisite:** Phase 1 completed successfully

```bash
# 1. Create new branch
git checkout -b cleanup/remove-frontend-skeletons

# 2. Delete expense-tax frontend
rm -rf "app/real-estate/expense-tax"
# KEEP: lib/modules/expense-tax/ (backend logic)
# KEEP: app/api/v1/expenses/ (API routes)

# 3. Delete cms-marketing
rm -rf "app/real-estate/cms-marketing"
rm "lib/modules/cms-marketing/dashboard-queries.ts"
rmdir "lib/modules/cms-marketing" 2>/dev/null  # Remove if empty

# 4. Delete marketplace frontend
rm -rf "app/real-estate/marketplace"
# KEEP: lib/modules/marketplace/ (backend logic)
# KEEP: components/real-estate/marketplace/ (components)
# KEEP: app/api/v1/ai-garage/ (API routes)

# 5. Search for references
grep -r "expense-tax\|expense_tax\|expenseTax" app lib components
grep -r "cms-marketing\|cms_marketing\|cmsMarketing" app lib components
grep -r "marketplace" app lib components | grep -v "lib/modules/marketplace\|components/real-estate/marketplace\|api/v1/ai-garage"

# 6. Run verification
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build

# 7. If all pass: Commit
git add -A
git commit -m "cleanup: remove frontend skeletons (expense-tax, cms-marketing, marketplace)

Removed:
- app/real-estate/expense-tax/ (3 files, ~200 lines)
- app/real-estate/cms-marketing/ (10+ files, ~500 lines)
- lib/modules/cms-marketing/dashboard-queries.ts (1 file, ~50 lines)
- app/real-estate/marketplace/ (3 files, ~200 lines)

Total: ~17 files, ~950 lines

Kept:
‚úÖ lib/modules/expense-tax/ (backend logic)
‚úÖ lib/modules/marketplace/ (backend logic)
‚úÖ components/real-estate/marketplace/ (components)
‚úÖ app/api/v1/expenses/ (API routes)
‚úÖ app/api/v1/ai-garage/ (API routes)

Rationale:
- Frontend routes are pure skeletons (Coming Soon banners)
- Backend logic is valuable for future implementation
- Components may be actively used

Verified:
‚úÖ TypeScript: 0 errors
‚úÖ Linting: 0 errors
‚úÖ Tests: All passing
‚úÖ Build: Successful
"
```

**Expected Impact:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Routes: These URLs will 404:
  - `/real-estate/expense-tax`
  - `/real-estate/cms-marketing`
  - `/real-estate/marketplace`
- **Action:** Remove from navigation if they exist
- ‚úÖ Backend: All backend logic preserved
- ‚úÖ APIs: All API routes functional

---

### Phase 3: Manual Review Deletions (Higher Risk)

**Target:** Type files and components with TODO comments

**Prerequisite:** Phases 1-2 completed successfully

```bash
# 1. Review type files
for file in lib/types/chatbot.ts \
            lib/types/real-estate/crm.ts \
            lib/types/real-estate/notifications.ts \
            lib/types/real-estate/projects.ts \
            lib/types/real-estate/tasks.ts; do
  echo "=== Checking: $file ==="
  grep -r "from.*$(basename $file .ts)" app lib components | grep -v node_modules
  echo ""
done

# 2. If 0 imports found for a file: Safe to delete
# Example (if unused):
# rm lib/types/chatbot.ts

# 3. Review CMS/Content components
echo "=== Checking content components ==="
grep -r "from.*content/campaigns\|from.*content/editor\|from.*content/media" app components

# 4. If 0 imports: Delete directories
# rm -rf components/real-estate/content/
# rm -rf components/real-estate/cms-marketing/

# 5. Review workspace components
for comp in onboarding-tour help-panel compliance-alerts workflow-templates; do
  echo "=== Checking: $comp ==="
  grep -r "import.*$comp\|<$(echo $comp | sed 's/-//g')" app components
done

# 6. If specific component unused: Delete individual files
# rm components/real-estate/workspace/onboarding-tour.tsx

# 7. Run verification after each deletion
npx tsc --noEmit && npm run lint && npm test

# 8. Commit incrementally
git add -A
git commit -m "cleanup: remove unused type files and components

Removed:
- [List specific files deleted]

Verified:
‚úÖ No imports found via grep
‚úÖ TypeScript: 0 errors
‚úÖ Linting: 0 errors
‚úÖ Tests: All passing
"
```

**Conservative Approach:**
- **Delete only if:** 0 imports found AND manual inspection confirms unused
- **Keep if:** Any doubt exists OR file is small (<50 lines)
- **Rationale:** Type files and components are low-cost to maintain

---

### Phase 4: Documentation Updates

**After all deletions:**

```bash
# 1. Update CLAUDE.md
# Remove references to deleted modules:
# - ai-hub
# - rei-analytics
# - expense-tax frontend
# - cms-marketing
# - marketplace frontend

# 2. Update README.md (if it exists)
# Remove skeleton module documentation

# 3. Update routing documentation
# Remove deleted routes from any route maps

# 4. Create cleanup report
cat > CLEANUP-REPORT-$(date +%Y%m%d).md << 'EOF'
# Platform Cleanup Report
*Date: $(date)*

```

---

## 13. Post-Cleanup Actions

### 13.1 Update Navigation

**Check for navigation links to deleted routes:**

```bash
# Search for navigation references
grep -r "ai-hub\|rei-analytics\|expense-tax\|cms-marketing\|marketplace" \
  components/shared/navigation/ \
  components/shared/layouts/ \
  lib/config/navigation.ts 2>/dev/null

# Remove links from:
# - Sidebar navigation
# - Dashboard quick links
# - Module cards
# - Settings pages
```

### 13.2 Update CLAUDE.md

**Edit:** `(platform)/CLAUDE.md`

**Changes:**
1. Remove ai-hub from skeleton modules list
2. Remove rei-analytics from skeleton modules list
3. Update expense-tax status (backend only)
4. Remove cms-marketing from module list
5. Update marketplace status (backend only)
6. Update module count (13 ‚Üí reduced number)
7. Update file counts in stats

### 13.3 Update .gitignore (if needed)

**Add to .gitignore:**
```
# Cleanup artifacts
CLEANUP-REPORT-*.md
*-after-cleanup.log
```

### 13.4 Performance Check

**Before/after comparison:**

```bash
# File counts
echo "Before: 1,797 files"
find . -type f \( -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" \) ! -path "./node_modules/*" ! -path "./.next/*" | wc -l
echo "After: [NEW COUNT] files"

# Directory size
echo "Before: 1.2 GB"
du -sh .
echo "After: [NEW SIZE]"

# Build time
echo "Before: [TIME]"
time npm run build
echo "After: [NEW TIME]"
```

## 14. Risk Assessment

### 14.1 Low Risk Deletions ‚úÖ

**ai-hub and rei-analytics modules:**
- **Risk Level:** VERY LOW
- **Confidence:** 99%
- **Rationale:**
  - Pure placeholder files with TODO comments
  - < 5% implementation
  - No dependencies found via grep
  - No database models in current schema
- **Impact:** None (404 on routes that show "Coming Soon" anyway)
- **Rollback:** Easy (restore 14 small files)

### 14.2 Medium Risk Deletions ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Frontend skeletons (expense-tax, cms-marketing, marketplace):**
- **Risk Level:** LOW-MEDIUM
- **Confidence:** 85%
- **Rationale:**
  - Frontend is pure skeleton
  - Backend logic preserved
  - Components may have unknown dependencies
- **Impact:** Routes 404, but backend APIs remain functional
- **Rollback:** Moderate (restore ~17 files)

### 14.3 Higher Risk Deletions ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

**Type files and components:**
- **Risk Level:** MEDIUM
- **Confidence:** 60-70%
- **Rationale:**
  - Static analysis may miss dynamic imports
  - Small files, low cost to keep
  - Some have TODO but may still be used
- **Impact:** Could break features if dependencies missed
- **Rollback:** Easy (small files)
- **Recommendation:** Only delete after thorough manual review

## 15. Alternative: Defer Instead of Delete

### 15.1 Deferral Strategy

**Instead of deleting, consider:**

1. **Create archive directory:**
```bash
mkdir -p .archived/2025-10-07
```

2. **Move skeleton modules to archive:**
```bash
mv app/real-estate/ai-hub .archived/2025-10-07/
mv app/real-estate/rei-analytics .archived/2025-10-07/
mv lib/modules/ai-hub .archived/2025-10-07/
mv lib/modules/rei-analytics .archived/2025-10-07/
```

3. **Update .gitignore:**
```
# Archived code
.archived/
```

4. **Benefits:**
- No risk of losing skeleton structure
- Easy to restore if needed
- Cleaner active codebase
- Preserved for reference

5. **Commit:**
```bash
git add .archived/ .gitignore
git commit -m "archive: move skeleton modules to .archived/

Archived modules:
- ai-hub (7 files, ~260 lines)
- rei-analytics (7 files, ~174 lines)

Rationale:
- < 5% implementation (placeholder only)
- Not needed for current development phase
- Preserved for future reference/restoration

Location: .archived/2025-10-07/
"
```

## 16. ‚ö†Ô∏è UPDATED: Final Recommendations (2025-10-07)

**üî¥ CRITICAL UPDATE:** All previous deletion recommendations are **OBSOLETE**.

### 16.1 ~~Immediate Actions~~ ‚Üí OBSOLETE - NO DELETIONS RECOMMENDED

**‚ö†Ô∏è UPDATE (2025-10-07): ALL FILES TO BE KEPT - MODULES IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT**

~~1. ai-hub module (7 files, ~260 lines)~~ ‚Üí ‚úÖ **KEEP - IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT**
~~2. rei-analytics module (7 files, ~174 lines)~~ ‚Üí ‚úÖ **KEEP - IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT**

**Updated Total:** 0 files for deletion, **ALL 14 FILES TO BE KEPT**

**Rationale:**
- Modules are in active development (not abandoned)
- TODO comments indicate planned features, not placeholders
- Skeleton structure is foundation for upcoming implementation
- Required for development roadmap

**Action:** **DO NOT DELETE** - Continue development

---

### 16.2 ~~Consider After Review~~ ‚Üí OBSOLETE - ALL FILES TO BE KEPT

**‚ö†Ô∏è UPDATE (2025-10-07): ALL FILES TO BE KEPT - MODULES IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT**

~~1. expense-tax frontend (3 files, ~200 lines)~~ ‚Üí ‚úÖ **KEEP ALL - Frontend being implemented**
~~2. cms-marketing (10+ files, ~500 lines)~~ ‚Üí ‚úÖ **KEEP ALL - All components in development**
~~3. marketplace frontend (3 files, ~200 lines)~~ ‚Üí ‚úÖ **KEEP ALL - Frontend being implemented**

**Updated Total:** 0 files for deletion, **ALL FILES TO BE KEPT**

**Rationale:**
- All modules are in active development
- Frontend routes are being implemented (currently skeleton placeholders)
- Backend logic is being expanded
- Components are part of ongoing work

**Action:** **DO NOT DELETE** - Continue development

---

### 16.3 Manual Review Required (Higher Risk, Lower Value)

**‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è Only delete after thorough verification:**

1. **Type files with TODOs** (5 files, ~80 lines)
   - Low priority: Small files, low maintenance cost
   - Verify 0 imports before deleting

2. **Workspace components** (4 files, ~600 lines)
   - Low priority: May be used via dynamic imports
   - Conservative: Keep (workspace is active module)

3. **CMS/Content components** (22 files, ~1,500 lines)
   - Medium priority: Potentially unused
   - Requires import verification

**Total:** ~31 files, ~2,180 lines, **~35-60 KB disk space**

**Confidence:** 50-60% safe to delete
**Impact:** Could break features if verification incomplete
**Rollback:** Easy (small files)
**Recommendation:** Keep unless confirmed unused

**üî¥ ALL DELETION PHASES OBSOLETE**

~~Conservative Approach (Phase 1 only):~~ ‚Üí **OBSOLETE**
- ~~Files: 14~~ ‚Üí **0 files to delete**
- ~~Lines: ~434~~ ‚Üí **0 lines to delete**
- ~~Disk Space: ~5-10 KB~~ ‚Üí **0 KB cleanup**

~~Moderate Approach (Phases 1-2):~~ ‚Üí **OBSOLETE**
- ~~Files: ~30-40~~ ‚Üí **0 files to delete**
- ~~Lines: ~1,334-3,334~~ ‚Üí **0 lines to delete**
- ~~Disk Space: ~20-60 KB~~ ‚Üí **0 KB cleanup**

~~Aggressive Approach (Phases 1-3):~~ ‚Üí **OBSOLETE**
- ~~Files: ~61-71~~ ‚Üí **0 files to delete**
- ~~Lines: ~3,514-5,514~~ ‚Üí **0 lines to delete**
- ~~Disk Space: ~60-120 KB~~ ‚Üí **0 KB cleanup**

**NEW APPROACH: KEEP ALL FILES - ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT**
- Files to keep: **ALL ~100+ files** across ai-hub, rei-analytics, expense-tax, cms-marketing, marketplace
- Status: **ALL IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT**
- Action: **Continue development on all modules**

---

### 16.5 ‚ö†Ô∏è UPDATED: Recommendation Summary (2025-10-07)

**Previous Cost-Benefit Analysis:** OBSOLETE

**NEW ANALYSIS:**

**Benefits of KEEPING Files (Updated 2025-10-07):**
- ‚úÖ Preserves active development work
- ‚úÖ Maintains skeleton structure for ongoing implementation
- ‚úÖ Avoids recreating foundation files
- ‚úÖ Supports development roadmap
- ‚úÖ Prevents confusion about deleted vs. deferred features

**Costs of Deletion (Now Avoided):**
- ‚ùå Would lose active development work
- ‚ùå Would require recreation of skeleton structure
- ‚ùå Would disrupt development roadmap
- ‚ùå Risk of breaking in-progress features

**Updated Verdict:**
- ~~Phase 1 (ai-hub, rei-analytics): HIGH VALUE~~ ‚Üí **OBSOLETE - MODULES IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT**
- ~~Phase 2 (frontend skeletons): MEDIUM VALUE~~ ‚Üí **OBSOLETE - FRONTEND BEING IMPLEMENTED**
- ~~Phase 3 (types, components): LOW VALUE~~ ‚Üí **OBSOLETE - COMPONENTS IN USE**

**NEW Recommendation:**
1. **KEEP ALL FILES** - All previously flagged modules are in active development
2. **Continue development** on ai-hub, rei-analytics, expense-tax, cms-marketing, marketplace
3. **No cleanup needed** - Files are not unused, they are in development

### C. Import Analysis Methodology

**Static Analysis Tools Used:**

1. **File Discovery:**
```bash
find . -type f \( -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" \) ! -path "./node_modules/*" ! -path "./.next/*"
```

2. **Import Pattern Matching:**
```bash
grep -r "from ['\"].*module-name" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" app lib components
```

3. **Component Usage Detection:**
```bash
grep -r "<ComponentName" --include="*.tsx" app components
```

4. **Dynamic Import Detection:**
```bash
grep -r "import(.*module-name" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" app lib components
```

**Limitations:**
- Static grep cannot detect:
  - Dynamic imports with variables
  - Computed property access
  - Reflection-based usage
  - Configuration-based references
- **Conservative approach:** Mark as "Review Needed" when uncertain
