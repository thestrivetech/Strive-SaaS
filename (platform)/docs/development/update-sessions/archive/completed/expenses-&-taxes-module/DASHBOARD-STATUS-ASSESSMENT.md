### Future Enhancements (Not Urgent)

These can be added in future sessions without affecting current functionality:

1. **Edit Expense Modal** (Session 8 placeholder exists)
   - Currently has placeholder button in ExpenseTable
   - Can be built following AddExpenseModal pattern

2. **Date Range Filtering** (Backend ready)
   - API supports startDate/endDate params
   - Can add date picker UI controls

3. **Quarterly Tax Breakdown** (Planned Session 8)
   - TaxEstimateCard shows annual estimate
   - Can add Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4 breakdown

4. **Receipt Library Page** (Planned Session 8)
   - Receipts stored in Supabase
   - Can create dedicated gallery view
