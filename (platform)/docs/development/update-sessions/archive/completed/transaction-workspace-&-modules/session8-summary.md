- **Tests Passing:** 60/60 ✅
- **Coverage:** All new modules fully tested
- **Type Check:** ✅ Pass (zero errors for new modules)
- **Lint Check:** Not run (existing errors in other modules)

### Test Breakdown:

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Workflow Template System
- **Template Creation:** Create reusable workflow templates with ordered steps
- **Step Dependencies:** Define step dependencies for sequential execution
- **Auto-Assignment:** Automatically assign tasks to parties based on role
- **Due Date Calculation:** Auto-calculate due dates based on estimated days
- **Validation:** Full Zod schema validation for data integrity

### 2. Workflow Application
- **Template to Loop:** Apply workflow templates to transaction loops
- **Task Generation:** Auto-generate tasks from workflow steps
- **Party Matching:** Match workflow roles to loop parties
- **Email Notifications:** Send task assignment emails to parties
- **Audit Logging:** Complete audit trail for all workflow actions

### 3. Milestone Tracking
- **Pre-defined Milestones:** 5 transaction types with specific milestones:
  - Purchase Agreement (6 milestones)
  - Listing Agreement (4 milestones)
  - Lease Agreement (4 milestones)
  - Commercial Purchase (6 milestones)
  - Commercial Lease (5 milestones)
- **Progress Calculation:** Weighted average of:
  - Tasks: 50%
  - Documents: 30%
  - Signatures: 20%
- **Current/Next Milestone:** Track current progress and next target
- **Visual Timeline:** Timeline UI component with progress indicators

### 4. Progress Automation
- **Auto-Update:** Progress auto-updates when tasks/docs/signatures change
- **Batch Recalculation:** Recalculate all active loops at once
- **Summary Statistics:** Organization-wide progress analytics
- **Distribution Metrics:** Progress distribution by status, type, and range

---

## 🔗 Integration Points Verified

- [x] Workflow module integrates with transaction_loops table
- [x] Workflow module integrates with transaction_tasks table
- [x] Workflow module integrates with loop_parties table
- [x] Milestone calculator reads from multiple related tables
- [x] Email notifications sent for task assignments
- [x] Audit logs created for all mutations
- [x] RLS/RBAC compliance verified in all actions

---

## ⚠️ Issues & Blockers

**None.** All features completed successfully.

### Minor Notes:
- Existing TypeScript errors in CRM calendar module (from previous sessions) - not addressed in this session
- Linting not run due to existing errors in other modules
- No database migration needed (workflows table already exists from Session 1)

---

## 📝 Notes for Next Session

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. **UI Integration:** Integrate workflow components into transaction detail page
2. **Workflow Builder:** Create visual workflow template builder
3. **Template Library:** Build pre-built template library for common workflows
4. **Analytics Dashboard:** Add workflow performance metrics
5. **Notification Preferences:** Allow users to customize task notifications

### Technical Debt:
- Consider adding workflow step conditions (if/then logic)
- Add workflow versioning for template updates
- Implement workflow pause/resume functionality
- Add bulk task operations (complete multiple tasks at once)

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. **Workflow Design:** Modular step-based workflows provide maximum flexibility
2. **Progress Calculation:** Weighted metrics give accurate transaction progress
3. **Type Safety:** Zod schemas catch validation errors early in development
4. **Testing Strategy:** Comprehensive mocking enables isolated unit testing
5. **UUID Validation:** Test data must match production validation rules
6. **Email Integration:** Async email sends shouldn't block main operations
7. **Audit Logging:** Every mutation tracked for compliance and debugging

---
