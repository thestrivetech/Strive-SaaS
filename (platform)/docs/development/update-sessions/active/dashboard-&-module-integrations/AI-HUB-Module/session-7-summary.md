## Key Implementations

### Design System Integration

**1. Platform Components Used:**
- ✅ `ModuleHeroSection` - Consistent page headers
- ✅ `EnhancedCard` - Glass effects and neon borders
- ✅ shadcn/ui components (Button, Badge, Avatar, Input, Select, Tabs)
- ✅ Lucide React icons (Bot, Brain, Zap, Users, Settings)

**2. Glass Morphism Effects:**
- Applied via `glassEffect` prop: "subtle", "medium", "strong"
- Used on all cards and modals
- Consistent blur and transparency

**3. Neon Borders:**
- Applied via `neonBorder` prop: cyan, purple, green, orange
- Agent cards: Cyan (primary), Purple (stats)
- Team cards: Purple (structure), Green (active), Orange (actions)
- Consistent with platform design system

**4. Status Indicators:**
- IDLE: Green dot (bg-green-500)
- BUSY: Yellow pulsing dot (bg-yellow-500 animate-pulse)
- OFFLINE: Gray dot (bg-gray-500)
- ERROR: Red dot (bg-red-500)
- Animated transitions with Framer Motion

**5. Responsive Layouts:**
- Mobile: 1 column
- Tablet: 2 columns (md:grid-cols-2)
- Desktop: 3 columns (lg:grid-cols-3)
- All layouts tested and responsive

### Backend Integration

**1. Agent Management:**
- Queries: `lib/modules/ai-hub/agents/queries.ts`
  - `getAgents()` - Fetch all agents for organization
  - `getAgentById()` - Fetch single agent with details
  - All queries filter by `organizationId`

- Actions: `lib/modules/ai-hub/agents/actions.ts`
  - `createAgent()` - Create new agent with validation
  - `updateAgent()` - Update agent configuration
  - `deleteAgent()` - Remove agent (cascade to executions)
  - All actions validate org ownership

**2. Team Management:**
- Queries: `lib/modules/ai-hub/teams/queries.ts`
  - `getTeams()` - Fetch all teams for organization
  - `getTeamById()` - Fetch team with members
  - Includes member agent details

- Actions: `lib/modules/ai-hub/teams/actions.ts`
  - `createTeam()` - Create team with structure
  - `updateTeam()` - Update team configuration
  - `deleteTeam()` - Remove team (cascade to members)

**3. Database Models Used:**
- `ai_agents` - Agent configurations
- `agent_teams` - Team orchestration
- `team_members` - Team membership
- `agent_executions` - Execution history (for metrics)

### Security Implementation

**1. Authentication:**
- ✅ All pages use `requireAuth()` (returns EnhancedUser)
- ✅ Redirect to login if not authenticated
- ✅ Organization membership verified

**2. Multi-Tenancy:**
- ✅ All queries filter by `organizationId`
- ✅ `setTenantContext()` called before database operations
- ✅ No cross-org data access possible

**3. RBAC Checks:**
- ✅ Dual-role validation (GlobalRole + OrganizationRole)
- ✅ Create/edit/delete actions restricted by role
- ✅ View access requires minimum MEMBER role

**4. Input Validation:**
- ✅ Zod schemas for all form inputs
- ✅ Agent creation validated before database insert
- ✅ Team creation validated before database insert
- ✅ API key/credential fields properly secured

**5. Subscription Tier Validation:**
- ✅ AI Hub requires GROWTH tier minimum
- ✅ Advanced features (teams) require ELITE tier
- ✅ Tier checks in frontend and backend

### ESLint Validation
```bash
npm run lint
```
- ✅ PASS - 0 warnings in new files
- All files follow platform code style
- No accessibility issues detected

### File Size Validation

   - `findUnique()` with org ownership validation
   - Includes: creator, executions (for metrics)

2. **agent_teams** - Team orchestration
   - `findMany()` with `organizationId` filter
   - `findUnique()` with members included
   - Includes: creator, members (with agent details)

3. **team_members** - Team membership
   - Queried via team includes
   - Agent details joined for avatars

4. **agent_executions** - Execution history
   - Aggregated for performance metrics
   - Success rate calculations
   - Average response time

### organizationId Filtering Confirmed
- ✅ All `findMany()` queries include `organizationId` filter
- ✅ All `findUnique()` queries validate org ownership
- ✅ `setTenantContext()` called at start of all queries
- ✅ No raw SQL queries (Prisma only)

## Session Notes

### What Went Well
1. **Design System Integration** - Seamless use of platform components
2. **File Organization** - Clear structure, easy to navigate
3. **Security Implementation** - Proper multi-tenancy from the start
4. **Component Reusability** - Cards, indicators, wizards all reusable
5. **Performance** - Efficient queries with proper filtering

### Lessons Learned
1. **Platform Components** - ModuleHeroSection and EnhancedCard save significant development time
2. **Wizard Pattern** - Multi-step forms need careful state management
3. **Status Indicators** - Real-time updates require polling or WebSocket (WebSocket for Session 8)
4. **Team Visualization** - Complex coordination patterns need visual representation

### Recommendations for Future Sessions
1. **Session 8** - Implement WebSocket for real-time execution monitoring
2. **Session 8** - Add charting library (Recharts or Chart.js) for analytics
3. **Post-Session 8** - Consider adding agent testing playground
4. **Post-Session 8** - Add agent marketplace for sharing configurations
