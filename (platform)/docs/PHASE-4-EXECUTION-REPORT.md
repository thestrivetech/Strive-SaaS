   - Located in:
     - `lib/auth/auth-helpers.ts` (requireAuth, getCurrentUser)
     - `lib/middleware/auth.ts`

2. **Testing (REQUIRED):**
   - Manual browser testing NOT YET DONE
   - All 76 test cases need execution
   - Console errors need monitoring
   - Responsive design needs verification
   - Issue documentation needed

3. **Test Files (LOW PRIORITY):**
   - 20 TypeScript errors in marketplace tests
   - Old enum values (CRM, ANALYTICS instead of FOUNDATION, GROWTH)
   - Doesn't affect functionality
   - Can be fixed later

### What's Missing ⏳

1. **Manual Testing Results:**
   - No browser testing completed yet
   - No issues documented yet
   - No screenshots captured
   - No console errors logged

2. **Production Readiness:**
   - Authentication bypass not removed
   - Test results not available

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions (Before Any Testing)

1. **Start Manual Testing:**
   - Open: http://localhost:3001/real-estate/marketplace/dashboard
   - Follow: MARKETPLACE-TESTING-QUICK-START.md
   - Start with: 15-minute smoke test
   - If smoke test passes: Complete all 10 flows

2. **Document Issues:**
   - Use issue template in test report
   - Take screenshots of visual issues
   - Copy console errors
   - Assign priorities (P0, P1, P2, P3)

### Before Production Deployment

1. **Remove Security Bypass (P0):**
   ```typescript
   // DELETE these blocks from:
   // - lib/auth/auth-helpers.ts (2 locations)
   // - lib/middleware/auth.ts (1 location)

   const isLocalhost = typeof window === 'undefined' &&
     (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' || process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV === 'local');

   if (isLocalhost) {
     return enhanceUser({
       id: 'demo-user',
       // ... mock user data
     });
   }
   ```

2. **Fix Critical Issues (P0/P1):**
   - Address all P0 blockers found in testing
   - Fix all P1 critical issues
   - Verify fixes with re-testing

3. **Verification Suite:**
   ```bash
   npm run lint        # Should show 0 errors
   npm run build       # Should succeed
   npx tsc --noEmit    # Should show 0 marketplace errors
   npm test            # Should pass (marketplace tests need enum fix)
   ```

### Quality Improvements

1. **Fix Test Files:**
   - Update enum values in test files
   - Change `ToolCategory.CRM` → `ToolCategory.FOUNDATION`
   - Change `ToolTier.STARTER` → `ToolTier.T1`
   - Run: `npm test -- marketplace`

2. **Performance Testing:**
   - Measure page load times
   - Check bundle sizes
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Test with large cart (15+ items)

3. **Accessibility:**
   - Test with screen reader
   - Verify keyboard navigation
   - Check color contrast
   - Validate ARIA labels
