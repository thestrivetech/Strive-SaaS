# Archived Components

**Purpose:** Preserved for future use with different organization UI customizations

**Status:** Not currently in use
**Do not import:** These components are archived for reference only

## Directory Structure

### /client-portal
- Components from previous client portal iterations
- Preserved for potential custom organization themes
- May be revived for specific client customizations

## Important Notes

- **Do not import from this directory** - Use current components instead
- Components may need significant updates before use
- Check for modern equivalents in `components/shared/` or `components/real-estate/`
- These are reference implementations, not production-ready

## Future Use Cases

- Custom organization-specific UIs
- Client-specific portal themes
- Reference implementations for new features
- Historical component patterns
