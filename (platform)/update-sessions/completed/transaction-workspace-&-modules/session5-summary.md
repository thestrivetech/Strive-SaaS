## 🎯 Features Implemented

### 1. Email Notification Service (`lib/email/notifications.ts`)
- SMTP configuration with nodemailer
- HTML email templates for signature requests
- Graceful fallback if SMTP not configured
- Environment variable validation
- Professional email styling

### 2. Signature Request Creation (`createSignatureRequest`)
- Create signature requests for multiple documents
- Create individual signatures for each (document × signer) combination
- Send email notifications to all signers with unique sign URLs
- Support sequential and parallel signing workflows
- Organization isolation (RLS enforcement)
- Audit trail capture

### 3. Document Signing (`signDocument`)
- Validate signature data and authentication
- Record IP address, user agent for audit trail
- Auto-detect request completion when all signatures done
- Update request status automatically
- Support for EMAIL, SMS, ID_VERIFICATION auth methods

### 4. Signature Decline (`declineSignature`)
- Allow signers to decline with reason
- Update request status (one decline fails entire request)
- Record decline reason for audit

### 5. Query Functions
- `getSignatureRequest` - Get full request with all signatures
- `getSignatureRequestsByLoop` - Paginated list with stats
- `getPendingSignatures` - Dashboard widget data
- `getSignatureById` - Public signing page data (no auth required)
- `getSignatureStats` - Loop-level statistics

---

## 🔐 Security Implementation

✅ **Multi-tenancy:** Organization isolation enforced via RLS
✅ **Input Validation:** All inputs validated with Zod schemas
✅ **RBAC:** Users with transaction access can request signatures
✅ **Audit Trail:** IP address, user agent, timestamps recorded
✅ **Expiration:** Optional expiration dates supported
✅ **No SQL Injection:** Prisma parameterized queries only

---

## 📊 Integration Points Verified

- [x] Database: Uses existing `signature_requests` and `document_signatures` tables
- [x] Auth: Integrates with `getCurrentUser()` and `getUserOrganizationId()`
- [x] Transactions: Links to `transaction_loops` table
- [x] Documents: Links to `documents` table
- [x] Parties: Links to `loop_parties` table (signers)
- [x] Revalidation: Cache invalidation via `revalidatePath()`

## 📝 Notes for Next Session

### Implementation Notes
1. **Email Configuration:**
   - Uses nodemailer with SMTP (not Resend)
   - Requires SMTP environment variables in `.env.local`
   - Falls back to mock transporter if not configured

2. **Sequential Signing:**
   - Data structure supports it (SigningOrder enum)
   - Email logic currently sends to all signers (PARALLEL mode)
   - Sequential enforcement to be implemented in future UI session

3. **Public Signing Page:**
   - `getSignatureById` query created (no auth required)
   - Public page UI to be created in future session
   - Sign URL format: `/transactions/sign/{signatureId}`

### Known Limitations
- Sequential signing not yet enforced (infrastructure in place)
- Public signing page UI not created (backend ready)
- Email delivery confirmation not tracked
- SMS and ID_VERIFICATION auth methods not implemented (only EMAIL)

### Future Enhancements
- Add signature position/coordinates for PDF placement
- Implement SMS OTP verification
- Add ID verification integration
- Create reminder emails for pending signatures
- Add signature templates
- Support bulk signature requests
