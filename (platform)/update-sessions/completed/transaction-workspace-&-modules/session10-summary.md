## 🎯 Features Implemented

### 1. Platform Navigation Integration

**Sidebar Navigation:**
- Added "Transactions" nav item with FileText icon
- Positioned between Projects and AI Assistant
- Visible only to EMPLOYEE, MODERATOR, SUPER_ADMIN roles
- Uses permission check: `canManageCustomers`

**Dashboard Integration:**
- Created main platform dashboard at `/real-estate/dashboard`
- Shows transaction stats for employees:
  - Total transaction loops
  - Active transactions
  - Closed transactions
  - Average days to close
- Quick access cards for CRM, Projects, Transactions
- Quick actions for creating contacts, transactions, projects

### 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Updated lib/auth/rbac.ts:**
- Added `/transactions` and `/real-estate/transactions` to route permissions
- Added to `getNavigationItems()` function
- Created new helper functions:
  - `canAccessTransactions()` - Check transaction access
  - `canManageTransactionLoops()` - Check create/edit permissions
  - `canDeleteTransactionLoops()` - Check delete permissions

**Access Matrix:**
| Role | Can Access Transactions | Can Create/Edit | Can Delete |
|------|------------------------|-----------------|------------|
| SUPER_ADMIN | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| MODERATOR | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| EMPLOYEE | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| CLIENT | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |

### 3. Subscription Tier Enforcement

**Tier Gate Component:**
- Checks user's subscription tier against required tier
- Tier hierarchy: FREE < BASIC < PRO < ENTERPRISE
- Shows upgrade prompt if insufficient tier
- Wrapped transaction layout to enforce PRO+ requirement

**Upgrade Prompt UI:**
- Shows current tier vs required tier
- Displays tier benefits and pricing
- CTAs for upgrading or returning to dashboard
- Links to billing settings and plan comparison

**Middleware Protection:**
- Added tier check in middleware (lib/middleware/auth.ts)
- Blocks FREE and BASIC users from `/transactions` routes
- Redirects to dashboard with `?upgrade=pro` query param
- PRO and ENTERPRISE users granted access

### 4. Onboarding Tour

**Custom Implementation:**
- Built custom tour (react-joyride doesn't support React 19)
- 4-step guided tour:
  1. Create Your First Transaction
  2. Upload Documents
  3. Invite Parties
  4. Request E-Signatures
- Uses localStorage to track completion
- Skippable with "Skip Tour" button
- Shows on first visit only
- Progress dots indicator
- Previous/Next navigation

### 5. Help Panel

**Contextual Help:**
- Floating help button (bottom-right corner)
- Accordion-style FAQ with 6 common questions:
  - How to create transaction loop
  - Party roles explanation
  - E-signature workflow
  - Workflow templates
  - Document security
  - Compliance customization
- Links to full documentation and support
- Collapsible panel to save screen space

### 6. Middleware Route Protection

**Updated lib/middleware/auth.ts:**
- Added `/transactions` route detection
- Dual check: Role + Subscription Tier
- Role enforcement: EMPLOYEE, MODERATOR, SUPER_ADMIN only
- Tier enforcement: PRO or ENTERPRISE required
- Redirects to `/real-estate/dashboard` if unauthorized
- Redirects to `/real-estate/dashboard?upgrade=pro` if insufficient tier
- Added `/dashboard` → `/real-estate/dashboard` redirect

### 7. Deployment Checklist

**Comprehensive Checklist Includes:**
- Pre-deployment checks (database, env vars, storage, code quality)
- Security checks (RLS, RBAC, encryption, validation)
- Performance targets (page load, database, caching)
- User acceptance testing (all transaction features)
- Go-live steps (deployment, smoke tests, monitoring)
- Post-deployment tasks (week 1, weeks 2-4, month 2+)
- Rollback plan (3 options: feature flag, database, partial)
- Critical warnings and must-dos
- Support contacts and resources

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Blockers

### 1. TypeScript Compilation Errors (Pre-existing)

**Role Constant Mismatches:**
- Test files reference `USER_ROLES.ADMIN` which doesn't exist in constants
- Constants has: ADMIN, MODERATOR, EMPLOYEE, CLIENT
- Prisma schema has: SUPER_ADMIN, ORG_ADMIN, MODERATOR, EMPLOYEE, CLIENT
- **Impact:** Test files won't compile
- **Resolution Needed:** Align role constants with Prisma schema

**CRM Calendar Form Type Errors:**
- Appointment form has type incompatibilities
- React Hook Form resolver type mismatches
- **Impact:** Calendar feature may have runtime issues
- **Resolution Needed:** Fix form type definitions

**Files Affected:**
- `__tests__/fixtures/users.ts`
- `__tests__/integration/auth-flow.test.ts`
- `app/api/v1/leads/route.ts`
- `components/layouts/admin-layout.tsx`
- `components/real-estate/crm/calendar/appointment-form-dialog.tsx`

### 2. Subscription Tier Naming Mismatch

**Database vs Documentation:**
- README.md (line 154) says: **Starter, Growth, Elite, Enterprise**
- Prisma schema enum says: **FREE, BASIC, PRO, ENTERPRISE**
- Tools constants say: **STARTER, GROWTH, ELITE, CUSTOM, ENTERPRISE**

**Current Mapping Used:**
- FREE → FREE (no access to transactions)
- BASIC → Starter equivalent (no access to transactions)
- PRO → Growth equivalent (**Transactions accessible**)
- ENTERPRISE → Enterprise (full access)

**Resolution Needed:**
- Database migration to update SubscriptionTier enum
- Or update documentation to match database enum
- User indicated "Don't worry about custom tier right now"

### 3. Missing Accordion Component

**Help Panel Dependency:**
- Uses `@/components/ui/accordion` which may not exist
- Imported from shadcn/ui
- **Resolution:** Install accordion component: `npx shadcn-ui@latest add accordion`

## 📝 Notes for Next Session

### Immediate Fixes Required:

1. **Role System Alignment:**
   - Update `lib/auth/constants.ts` to match Prisma schema
   - Change ADMIN → SUPER_ADMIN in constants
   - Add ORG_ADMIN to constants
   - Fix all test files referencing USER_ROLES.ADMIN

2. **Subscription Tier Migration:**
   - Decision needed: Keep database enum or migrate?
   - If migrating: Create migration to rename tiers
   - Update all references to tier names
   - Update tier enforcement logic

3. **Install Missing UI Components:**
   ```bash
   cd "(platform)"
   npx shadcn-ui@latest add accordion
   npx shadcn-ui@latest add badge  # if not installed
   ```

4. **CRM Calendar Type Fixes:**
   - Fix appointment form resolver types
   - Ensure form validation working correctly

### Future Enhancements:

1. **Onboarding Tour:**
   - Add tour targets (`data-tour` attributes) to transaction pages
   - Consider video tutorials in help panel
   - Add "Restart Tour" option in settings

2. **Tier Gate Improvements:**
   - Add trial period support
   - Show "days remaining" for trials
   - Add "Request Demo" CTA for Enterprise

3. **Analytics:**
   - Track tour completion rate
   - Monitor upgrade conversion from tier gate
   - Measure help panel usage

4. **Testing:**
   - Add integration tests for tier enforcement
   - Test middleware role + tier checks
   - E2E test for onboarding tour
