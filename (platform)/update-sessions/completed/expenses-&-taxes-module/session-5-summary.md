## Key Implementations

### KPI Summary Dashboard
**Four Key Performance Indicators:**

1. **Total Expenses YTD**
   - Amount: Year-to-date total expenses in USD
   - Count: Total number of expense records
   - Icon: DollarSign (blue)
   - Format: Currency with no decimals

2. **This Month**
   - Amount: Current month spending in USD
   - Subtitle: "Current month spending"
   - Icon: Calendar (green)
   - Format: Currency with no decimals

3. **Tax Deductible**
   - Amount: Total deductible expenses in USD
   - Percentage: Calculated as (deductible / total) × 100
   - Icon: FileText (purple)
   - Format: Currency + percentage

4. **Total Receipts**
   - Count: Number of receipts uploaded
   - Subtitle: Proper pluralization (receipt/receipts)
   - Icon: Receipt (orange)
   - Format: Number only

### API Data Flow
```
User visits dashboard
    ↓
Server Component renders with Suspense
    ↓
ExpenseKPIs (Client Component) mounts
    ↓
TanStack Query fetches from /api/v1/expenses/summary
    ↓
API authenticates and gets organizationId
    ↓
Prisma aggregates expense data (4 queries)
    ↓
JSON response with KPI data
    ↓
ExpenseKPIs displays formatted cards
    ↓
Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
```

### Responsive Design
**Breakpoints:**
- Mobile (< 768px): 1 column grid
- Tablet (768px - 1024px): 2 column grid
- Desktop (> 1024px): 4 column grid

**Grid Implementation:**
```css
grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4
```

### Loading States
**Three-tier loading strategy:**
1. **Page-level:** `loading.tsx` with full page skeleton
2. **Component-level:** Suspense boundary with `DashboardSkeleton`
3. **Data-level:** TanStack Query loading state with skeleton cards

---

## Security Implementation

### Multi-Tenancy
- ✅ All API queries filtered by `organizationId`
- ✅ No cross-organization data access possible
- ✅ Organization context enforced at database level
- ✅ User's organization from session authentication

### Authentication
- ✅ `requireAuth()` on dashboard page
- ✅ `requireAuth()` on API endpoint
- ✅ Redirect to `/login` if not authenticated
- ✅ Redirect to `/onboarding/organization` if no org

### RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
- ✅ No specific role checks needed (viewing own org data)
- ✅ Ready for future tier enforcement (STARTER tier minimum)
- ✅ Backend RBAC helpers available for future features

### Input Validation
- ✅ API endpoint validates session and organization
- ✅ Prisma aggregate queries are SQL-injection safe
- ✅ Error responses don't leak sensitive data
- ✅ TypeScript types enforce data structure

---

## Database Queries

### API Summary Endpoint Queries

**1. YTD Total Expenses:**
```typescript
await prisma.expense.aggregate({
  where: {
    organization_id: organizationId,
    expense_date: { gte: yearStart }
  },
  _sum: { amount: true },
  _count: true
});
```

**2. Monthly Total Expenses:**
```typescript
await prisma.expense.aggregate({
  where: {
    organization_id: organizationId,
    expense_date: { gte: monthStart }
  },
  _sum: { amount: true }
});
```

**3. Deductible Expenses:**
```typescript
await prisma.expense.aggregate({
  where: {
    organization_id: organizationId,
    expense_date: { gte: yearStart },
    is_deductible: true
  },
  _sum: { amount: true }
});
```

**4. Receipt Count:**
```typescript
await prisma.receipt.count({
  where: {
    expense: {
      organization_id: organizationId
    }
  }
});
```

**Performance:** 4 optimized aggregate queries with proper indexing

- ✅ API route: 91 lines - 18% of limit
- ✅ Average file size: 88 lines
- ✅ All files well under 500-line ESLint hard limit

### Component Testing Checklist

---

## UI/UX Highlights

### Design System
- **Framework:** Tailwind CSS utility classes
- **Components:** shadcn/ui (Card, Button, Skeleton)
- **Icons:** Lucide React (DollarSign, Calendar, FileText, Receipt)
- **Theme:** Light/dark mode with CSS variables
- **Typography:** System font stack with proper hierarchy

### User Experience
- **Loading:** Skeleton placeholders match final layout
- **Empty State:** Shows "$0" when no expenses exist
- **Error Handling:** User-friendly messages with retry option
- **Real-time:** Auto-refresh keeps data current
- **Performance:** Optimized queries, minimal client JS

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Color contrast meets WCAG standards
- Interactive elements keyboard accessible
- Screen reader friendly labels

---

## Architecture Decisions

### Server vs Client Components
**Server Components (faster initial load, less JS):**
- ✅ Dashboard page (`page.tsx`)
- ✅ ExpenseHeader (`ExpenseHeader.tsx`)
- ✅ DashboardSkeleton (`DashboardSkeleton.tsx`)

**Client Components (interactive features):**
- ✅ ExpenseKPIs (`ExpenseKPIs.tsx`) - Uses TanStack Query hooks

**Rationale:** Minimize client JavaScript, maximize performance

### Route Structure
- ✅ Main route: `/real-estate/expense-tax/`
- ✅ Dashboard: `/real-estate/expense-tax/dashboard/`
- ✅ API: `/api/v1/expenses/summary`
- ✅ Components: `components/real-estate/expense-tax/dashboard/`

**Note:** Route uses `expense-tax` (not `expenses`) per platform standards

### State Management
- **Server State:** TanStack Query (API data)
- **No Local State:** All data from backend
- **Auto-refresh:** 30s interval with stale-while-revalidate
- **Cache:** 20s stale time for optimal UX
