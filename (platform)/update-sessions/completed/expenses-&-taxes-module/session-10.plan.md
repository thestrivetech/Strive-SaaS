# Session 10: Testing, Polishing & Documentation

## Session Overview
**Goal:** Complete comprehensive testing, UI polish, performance optimization, and documentation.

**Duration:** 3-4 hours
**Complexity:** Medium
**Dependencies:** Sessions 1-9 (All features must be complete)

## Objectives

1. ✅ Write comprehensive unit tests for all modules
2. ✅ Create integration tests for critical flows
3. ✅ Implement E2E tests with Playwright
4. ✅ Performance optimization and lazy loading
5. ✅ UI polish and accessibility improvements
6. ✅ Create module documentation
7. ✅ Final security audit and RBAC verification
8. ✅ Prepare for deployment

## Prerequisites

- [x] Sessions 1-9 completed (All features implemented)
- [x] Testing infrastructure configured
- [x] Understanding of testing best practices

## Design System Integration

**Dashboard Pattern:** This module uses the platform's standard dashboard components:
- `ModuleHeroSection` for hero sections with integrated stats
- `EnhancedCard` with glass effects (`glassEffect="strong"`) and neon borders (`neonBorder="cyan|purple|orange"`)
- Framer Motion for page transition animations
- 2-column responsive layout (lg:col-span-2 + lg:col-span-1)

**Reference Implementations:**
- Expense Dashboard: `app/real-estate/expense-tax/dashboard/page.tsx`
- CRM Dashboard: `app/real-estate/crm/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Workspace Dashboard: `app/real-estate/workspace/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Component Imports:**
```tsx
import { ModuleHeroSection } from '@/components/shared/dashboard/ModuleHeroSection';
import { EnhancedCard, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardContent } from '@/components/shared/dashboard/EnhancedCard';
import { HeroSkeleton } from '@/components/shared/dashboard/skeletons';
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';
```

**Testing Focus:**
- Test `ModuleHeroSection` integration and stat display
- Verify `EnhancedCard` hover effects and animations
- Test Framer Motion animations (no performance degradation)
- Ensure glass effects render correctly in light/dark mode
- Verify neon borders display properly on all cards
- Test responsive layout on mobile (375px), tablet (768px), desktop (1440px)

├── tax-estimates.test.ts      # Tax calculation tests
└── reports.test.ts            # Report generation tests
```

### Integration Tests

## Performance Optimization

### Checklist
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for charts
- [ ] Add pagination for large expense lists
- [ ] Optimize image loading for receipts
- [ ] Enable React Query caching
- [ ] Code splitting for analytics page
- [ ] Minimize bundle size

### Files to Optimize
- `ExpenseTable.tsx` - Add virtualization for large lists
- `CategoryBreakdown.tsx` - Lazy load chart library
- `SpendingTrends.tsx` - Debounce data refreshes

## UI Polish

### Accessibility
- [ ] Add ARIA labels to all interactive elements
- [ ] Ensure keyboard navigation works

- [ ] Empty state designs
- [ ] Error boundary components

## Security Audit

### Checklist
- [ ] Verify RLS policies on all tables
- [ ] Test multi-tenancy isolation
- [ ] Validate RBAC on all Server Actions
- [ ] Check file upload validation
- [ ] Verify receipt storage security
- [ ] Test SQL injection prevention
- [ ] Validate XSS protection
- [ ] Review environment variable usage

### Test Scenarios
1. **Multi-tenancy:** Try accessing another org's expenses
2. **RBAC:** Test with different user roles (Admin, Member, Viewer)
3. **File upload:** Test malicious file uploads
4. **Input validation:** Test edge cases and malformed data
