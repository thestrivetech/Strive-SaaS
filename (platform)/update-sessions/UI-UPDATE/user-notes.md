# Entire Platform #
Use transaction dashboard as base dashboard design since it has notifications icon and account icon.

# Login/Signup Page #

Create Onoarding Page with Pricing tiers and organization signup so we can get all necessary information -> After user signs in it looks for onboarding but it doesn't exist (make sure for testing purposes that the test credentials recieves full dev admin access without having to pay, still make the display tier dependant though depending on what tier is selected)
    - Make sure logic exists to where returning users don't have to go to the onboarding page every time

Remove the coming soon badge

Remove text box color effect once user has entered their email -> Just leave it the way it is at first

# Onboarding Pages #

First organization page is boo boo. It needs to be beautiful
