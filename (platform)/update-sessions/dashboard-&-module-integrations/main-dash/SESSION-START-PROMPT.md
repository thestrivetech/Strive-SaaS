## ðŸ“‹ Session Start Prompt

```
I'm starting Session 3 of the Main Dashboard integration project.

Please follow these steps to begin:

1. **Read Development Rules:**
   - Read the root CLAUDE.md file at: C:\Users\zochr\Desktop\GitHub\Strive-SaaS\CLAUDE.md
   - Read the platform-specific CLAUDE.md at: C:\Users\zochr\Desktop\GitHub\Strive-SaaS\(platform)\CLAUDE.md
   - Understand and follow all development rules, security requirements, and architectural patterns

2. **Read Session Plan:**
   - Read the session plan file at: C:\Users\zochr\Desktop\GitHub\Strive-SaaS\(platform)\update-sessions\dashboard-&-module-integrations\main-dash\session-3.plan.md
   - Understand the objectives, requirements, and implementation steps
   - Note all dependencies and prerequisites

3. **Review Integration Guide:**
   - Read the main dashboard integration plan at: C:\Users\zochr\Desktop\GitHub\Strive-SaaS\(platform)\update-sessions\dashboard-&-module-integrations\main-dash\main-dashboard-integration-plan.md
   - Understand the overall architecture and design principles
   - Note UI/UX requirements and component patterns

4. **Create Detailed Todo List:**
   - Break down the session plan into actionable todo items
   - Use the TodoWrite tool to create an in-depth todo list with:
     * Specific, granular tasks (not vague descriptions)
     * Proper status (pending/in_progress/completed)
     * Active form descriptions for in-progress items
   - Include todos for:
     * Reading/analyzing existing code
     * Creating new files
     * Modifying existing files
     * Testing implementations
     * Validating security/RBAC/multi-tenancy
     * Any additional tasks from the session plan

5. **Important Reminders:**
   - ALWAYS read files before editing them
   - Follow the READ-BEFORE-EDIT MANDATE from CLAUDE.md
   - Maintain multi-tenancy (organizationId on all queries)
   - Enforce RBAC permissions on all Server Actions
   - Use Supabase MCP tools for all database operations (schema changes, migrations, queries)
   - Validate all input with Zod schemas
   - Add proper error handling and loading states
   - Ensure mobile responsiveness
   - Follow clean dashboard design principles

6. **Database Operations:**
   - For schema changes: Use Supabase MCP `apply_migration` tool
   - For queries: Use Supabase MCP `execute_sql` tool
   - For inspections: Use Supabase MCP `list_tables` tool
   - DO NOT use prisma CLI commands directly - use MCP tools instead

7. **Dashboard-Specific Guidelines:**
   - Use Server Components by default, Client Components only when needed
   - Implement TanStack Query for data fetching in client components
   - Add Suspense boundaries for streaming UI
   - Ensure all metrics calculations are cached (5-minute TTL)
   - Activity feed should auto-refresh every minute
   - All widgets should have configurable refresh rates
   - Follow the clean, professional UI design from the integration plan

8. **Component Standards:**
   - KPI Cards: Display metrics with trend indicators
   - Charts: Use Recharts for visualizations
   - Activity Feed: Real-time updates with filtering
   - Quick Actions: Track usage and execute properly
   - Module Shortcuts: Navigate to correct routes
   - Loading States: Always provide skeletons
   - Error States: User-friendly error messages

9. **Session End Requirements:**
   When the session is complete, create a session summary file:
   - File path: C:\Users\zochr\Desktop\GitHub\Strive-SaaS\(platform)\update-sessions\dashboard-&-module-integrations\main-dash\session-3-summary.md
   - Include:
     * Session objectives (completed/partial/not started)
     * Files created (full list with paths)
     * Files modified (full list with paths)
     * Key implementations and features added
     * Any issues encountered and how they were resolved
     * Testing performed
     * Next steps / what's ready for next session
     * Overall progress percentage for the entire Main Dashboard integration

Let's begin Session 3!
```

## ðŸš¨ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### General
1. **Don't skip reading existing files** - Always use Read tool before Edit
2. **Don't forget organizationId** - Every dashboard model needs multi-tenancy
3. **Don't skip RBAC checks** - Every Server Action needs permission validation
4. **Don't use Prisma CLI directly** - Use Supabase MCP tools instead
5. **Don't create duplicate code** - Check if components/modules already exist
6. **Don't forget revalidatePath** - Call after mutations for fresh data
7. **Don't skip error handling** - Wrap database calls in try/catch
8. **Don't hardcode values** - Use environment variables and configs

### Dashboard-Specific
9. **Don't block rendering** - Use Suspense for each section independently
10. **Don't skip caching** - Metrics should be cached (300s default)
11. **Don't forget loading states** - Every component needs skeleton UI
12. **Don't use 'use client' everywhere** - Server Components by default
13. **Don't skip mobile testing** - Test on 320px, 768px, 1024px widths
14. **Don't forget accessibility** - Add ARIA labels, semantic HTML
15. **Don't skip performance profiling** - Use React DevTools Profiler
