## Session Initialization Prompt

```
I'm working on the Tool & Dashboard Marketplace integration for the Strive-SaaS platform.

PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Location: (platform)/ directory
- Tech Stack: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Prisma, Supabase
- Architecture: Multi-tenant SaaS with RLS and RBAC
- Integration Guide: tool-marketplace-integration-plan.md

CURRENT SESSION: [SESSION NUMBER - e.g., "Session 1", "Session 2", etc.]

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Read the session plan file: session-[NUMBER].plan.md
2. Follow the step-by-step implementation exactly as documented
3. Use Supabase MCP tools for all database operations (migrations, queries)
4. Maintain multi-tenancy with organizationId on all relevant tables
5. Implement RBAC checks in all Server Actions
6. Follow the exact UI design patterns from the integration guide
7. Add proper error handling and validation
8. Include testing as specified in the session plan

CRITICAL RULES:
- READ files before editing (mandatory)
- Use EDIT tool for existing files, WRITE only for new files
- Never exceed 500 lines per file (hard limit)
- Always validate input with Zod
- Enforce RLS on multi-tenant tables
- Check RBAC permissions in all actions
- Use Supabase MCP tools for migrations (NOT Prisma CLI)

Please confirm you're ready to begin [SESSION NAME] and summarize the objectives.

## Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### Issue 1: Supabase MCP Tool Not Found
```
Error: mcp__supabase__apply_migration not available

Fix: Ensure Supabase MCP server is configured in claude_desktop_config.json
```

### Issue 2: RLS Policy Errors
```
Error: RLS policy violation

Fix: Ensure app.current_org_id is set before queries:
await prisma.$executeRaw`SET app.current_org_id = ${orgId};`
```

### Issue 3: File Size Limit Exceeded
```
Error: File exceeds 500 lines

Fix: Extract logic into separate files/modules
- Create utility functions
- Split components
- Move types to separate file
```

### Issue 4: Multi-Tenancy Not Working
```
Error: Data leak between organizations

Fix: Always use withTenantContext() wrapper and include organizationId in queries
```

### Issue 5: RBAC Permission Denied
```
Error: Unauthorized access

Fix: Add proper RBAC checks:
- requireAuth() at start of Server Actions
- canAccessMarketplace(user) check
- canPurchaseTools(user) for purchases
```
