## 🧪 Testing Status

### Database Verification:
- ✅ Migration applied successfully (migration: `add_transaction_management`)
- ✅ All 9 tables created in database
- ✅ All 9 enums created
- ✅ RLS enabled on all tables
- ✅ 30 RLS policies created and verified
- ✅ Indexes created on key fields

### Prisma Client Generation:
⚠️ **BLOCKED** - Windows file lock on `query_engine-windows.dll.node`

**Resolution Required:**
```bash
# Close VS Code and any dev servers, then run:
cd (platform)
npx prisma generate --schema=../shared/prisma/schema.prisma
```

### Type Checking:
⏸️ **PENDING** - Requires Prisma client generation first

### Seed Data:
⏸️ **PENDING** - Can be created in Session 2 or run manually

---

## 🔗 Integration Points

### With Shared Prisma Schema:
- ✅ All transaction models available to all three projects (chatbot, platform, website)
- ✅ User model updated with 7 new transaction relations
- ✅ Organization model updated with 3 new transaction relations

### With Platform Auth System:
- ✅ created_by fields link to users table
- ✅ organization_id fields link to organizations table
- ✅ RLS policies use auth.uid() for user context

### With Supabase:
- ✅ RLS policies use Supabase auth.uid()
- ✅ organizationId filtering via organization_members join
- ✅ Storage integration ready (storage_key field in documents)

---

## ⚠️ Issues & Blockers

### Fixed During Session:
1. ✅ **Prisma Relation Error** - contacts.appointments relation missing opposite field
   - **Fix:** Added contact_id and relation to appointments model

### Outstanding Issues:
1. ⚠️ **Prisma Client Generation Blocked**
   - **Issue:** Windows file lock on query engine DLL
   - **Impact:** Cannot verify TypeScript types or run type checking
   - **Resolution:** User needs to close VS Code/dev servers and regenerate client
   - **Priority:** Medium (doesn't block Session 2 planning)

## 📝 Notes for Session 2

### Ready for Next Session:
1. ✅ Database schema complete and migrated
2. ✅ RLS policies in place
3. ✅ Multi-tenancy configured

### Before Starting Session 2 (Storage & File Management):
1. 🔄 Generate Prisma client (resolve file lock issue)
2. 🔄 Run type check to verify no errors

### Session 2 Dependencies:
- **Document model** ✅ Ready - storage_key field added
- **storage_key field** ✅ Ready - unique constraint added
