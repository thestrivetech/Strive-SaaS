# Session 4: Agent Teams Module - Backend & API

## Session Overview
**Goal:** Implement agent team orchestration with coordination patterns (hierarchical, collaborative, pipeline, democratic) and multi-agent task execution.

**Duration:** 3-4 hours
**Complexity:** High
**Dependencies:** Session 1, 2, 3

## Objectives

1. ✅ Create agent teams module (schemas, queries, actions)
2. ✅ Implement team coordination patterns
3. ✅ Add team member management
4. ✅ Create team execution engine
5. ✅ Implement role-based agent assignment
6. ✅ Add team performance metrics
7. ✅ Create API routes

## Module Structure

```
lib/modules/ai-hub/teams/
├── index.ts           # Public API exports
├── schemas.ts         # Zod validation schemas
├── queries.ts         # Data fetching functions
├── actions.ts         # Server Actions
├── execution.ts       # Team execution engine
├── patterns.ts        # Coordination patterns
└── utils.ts           # Team utilities
```

## Coordination Patterns

### 1. Hierarchical
- Leader agent delegates tasks
- Workers report back results
- Leader synthesizes final output

### 2. Collaborative
- All agents work on same task
- Equal contribution weights
- Consensus building

### 3. Pipeline
- Sequential agent processing
- Output of agent N → Input of agent N+1
- Linear workflow

### 4. Democratic
- All agents vote on decisions
- Majority or weighted voting
- Conflict resolution

## Team Roles

- **LEADER** - Coordinates and synthesizes
- **WORKER** - Executes assigned tasks
- **COORDINATOR** - Manages communication
- **SPECIALIST** - Domain expert for specific tasks

## Implementation Highlights

### Team Execution
- Pattern-based coordination
- Parallel vs sequential execution
- Result aggregation
- Error handling and retries

### Member Management
- Add/remove agents dynamically
- Role assignment
- Priority ordering
- Capability matching

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/v1/ai-hub/teams` - List teams
- `POST /api/v1/ai-hub/teams` - Create team
- `GET /api/v1/ai-hub/teams/[id]` - Get team details
- `PATCH /api/v1/ai-hub/teams/[id]` - Update team
- `DELETE /api/v1/ai-hub/teams/[id]` - Delete team
- `POST /api/v1/ai-hub/teams/[id]/members` - Add team member
- `DELETE /api/v1/ai-hub/teams/[id]/members/[memberId]` - Remove member
- `POST /api/v1/ai-hub/teams/[id]/execute` - Execute team task

## Files to Create

- ✅ `lib/modules/ai-hub/teams/**` - All team module files
- ✅ `app/api/v1/ai-hub/teams/**` - All API routes

## Success Criteria

- [x] Agent teams module complete
- [x] All coordination patterns implemented
- [x] Team execution engine working
- [x] Member management functional
- [x] Server Actions with RBAC
- [x] API routes created

## Next Steps
