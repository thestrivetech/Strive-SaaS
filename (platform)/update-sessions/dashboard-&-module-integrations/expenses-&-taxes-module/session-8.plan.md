# Session 8: Analytics & Reports Pages

## Session Overview
**Goal:** Implement Analytics page with trends and Reports page with generation capabilities.

**Duration:** 3-4 hours
**Complexity:** High
**Dependencies:** Session 7 (Tax and charts must be complete)

## Objectives

1. ✅ Create Analytics page (`/expenses/analytics`)
2. ✅ Implement spending trends charts (monthly, YTD)
3. ✅ Add expense comparison visualizations
4. ✅ Create Reports page (`/expenses/reports`)
5. ✅ Implement report generation form
6. ✅ Add report list with download options
7. ✅ Implement export functionality (CSV placeholder)

## Prerequisites

- [x] Session 7 completed (Charts ready)
- [x] Reports backend complete
- [x] Chart libraries configured

## Design System Integration

**Dashboard Pattern:** This module uses the platform's standard dashboard components:
- `ModuleHeroSection` for hero sections with integrated stats
- `EnhancedCard` with glass effects (`glassEffect="strong"`) and neon borders (`neonBorder="cyan|purple|orange"`)
- Framer Motion for page transition animations
- 2-column responsive layout (lg:col-span-2 + lg:col-span-1)

**Reference Implementations:**
- Expense Dashboard: `app/real-estate/expense-tax/dashboard/page.tsx`
- CRM Dashboard: `app/real-estate/crm/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Workspace Dashboard: `app/real-estate/workspace/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Component Imports:**
```tsx
import { ModuleHeroSection } from '@/components/shared/dashboard/ModuleHeroSection';
import { EnhancedCard, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardContent } from '@/components/shared/dashboard/EnhancedCard';
import { HeroSkeleton } from '@/components/shared/dashboard/skeletons';
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';
```

**Visual Design:**
- Use `EnhancedCard` for all report cards and analytics sections
- Apply neon borders: cyan (primary), purple (secondary), orange (accent)
- Wrap main content in `motion.div` with fade-in animation
- Ensure glass effects work in light and dark mode
