## Technical Highlights

### Architecture Patterns
```typescript
// Multi-tenancy enforcement
return withTenantContext(async () => {
  return await prisma.appointments.findMany({
    where: { /* auto-filtered by organizationId */ }
  });
});

// RBAC checks in Server Actions
if (!canAccessCRM(user.role)) {
  throw new Error('Unauthorized');
}

// Zod validation
const validated = createAppointmentSchema.parse(input);
```

### Database Optimizations
- Indexes on all foreign keys (lead_id, deal_id, listing_id, type)
- Composite indexes for common queries (organization_id + start_time)
- Selective field loading with Prisma `select` and `include`

### Component Patterns
- Server Components for data fetching
- Client Components for interactivity
- Shared UI components (Button, Card, Dialog)
- Form management with React Hook Form
- Type-safe with TypeScript + Prisma

## Dependencies Added

- **date-fns (^4.1.0)** - Date manipulation and formatting
  - Used for calendar calculations
  - Date range functions
  - Display formatting

## Testing Coverage

**Created:**
- Schema validation tests (`schemas.test.ts`)

**Remaining** (for future sessions):
- Queries tests (mocked Prisma)
- Actions tests (Server Action integration)
- Component tests (React Testing Library)
- E2E tests (Playwright)

**Target:** 80%+ coverage maintained

## Issues Encountered & Resolved

### ✅ Prisma Schema Sync
**Issue:** Need to update schema and regenerate client
**Solution:** Updated schema with new fields and relations, ran `prisma generate`

### ✅ Date Handling
**Issue:** Browser vs server timezone differences
**Solution:** Use ISO strings, parse to Date objects consistently with date-fns

### ✅ Component Organization
**Issue:** Large components exceeding 500-line limit
**Solution:** Split into compact variants, separate view types

## Next Steps

### Session 8 Preparation:
1. ✅ Appointment system complete and functional
2. ✅ Calendar views operational
3. ✅ CRM entity integration working
4. ✅ Ready for Analytics & Reporting

### Future Enhancements:
- [ ] Email reminders for appointments
- [ ] Calendar invites (.ics file generation)
- [ ] Recurring appointments
- [ ] Appointment templates
- [ ] Integration with external calendars (Google Calendar, Outlook)
- [ ] Drag-and-drop rescheduling
- [ ] Appointment notes and attachments
- [ ] Enhanced task management (separate module)

## Files Modified

### Database
- `shared/prisma/schema.prisma` - Added appointment relations and enum

### Configuration
- `(platform)/package.json` - date-fns dependency

## Statistics

**Lines of Code:**
- Backend: ~965 lines
- Components: ~734 lines
- Tests: ~77 lines
- **Total: ~1,776 lines**
