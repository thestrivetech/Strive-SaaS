```
Create queries file for reid_ai_profiles table in (platform)

Location: lib/modules/reid/ai/queries.ts

Requirements:
- Create Server Actions for reid_ai_profiles CRUD operations
- Implement getAIProfiles(filters?) - fetch all profiles for organization
- Implement getAIProfileById(id) - fetch single profile
- Implement getAIProfileStats() - aggregate stats (total, avg scores, etc.)
- Filter ALL queries by organizationId (multi-tenancy)
- Include RBAC check using canAccessREID(user)
- Use TypeScript strict types
- Export all functions with proper JSDoc comments

Database:

- Table name: reid_ai_profiles
- Key fields: id, organization_id, profile_type, summary, overall_score, investment_score, recommendations
- Use existing pattern from lib/modules/reid/reports/queries.ts

Security:
- requireAuth() for all functions
- canAccessREID(user) permission check
- Filter by user.organizationId in ALL queries
- No cross-organization data access

Follow patterns from:
- lib/modules/reid/reports/queries.ts (similar structure)
- lib/modules/workspace/core/queries.ts (RBAC pattern)

Verification:
- npx tsc --noEmit (zero errors)
- Confirm all exports work with import test
- File size under 500 lines
```

## üéØ TASK 2: Update AIProfilesClient with Real Data

### Agent Prompt
```
Update AIProfilesClient component to use real reid_ai_profiles database data in (platform)

Location: components/real-estate/reid/ai-profiles/AIProfilesClient.tsx

Current State:
- Component returns empty data (setProfiles([]))
- Has outdated comment: "Placeholder - REID is a skeleton module"
- UI fully built with filters, stats, cards

Requirements:
- Import getAIProfiles and getAIProfileStats from lib/modules/reid/ai/queries
- Replace loadData() function to fetch real data using Server Actions
- Update stats calculation to use getAIProfileStats()
- Replace MockAIProfile type with actual Prisma reid_ai_profiles type
- Keep all existing filter logic (status, recommendation, score)
- Add proper error handling with try/catch
- Add empty state message when no profiles exist
- Maintain existing loading states
- Remove outdated "skeleton module" comment

Data Fetching Pattern:
- Use Server Actions (not client-side fetch)
- Call queries in loadData() function
- Handle loading, error, and empty states
- Apply client-side filters after data fetch

Security:
- Server Actions automatically enforce organizationId filtering
- No additional security checks needed in client

Follow patterns from:
- components/real-estate/reid/reports/ReportsClient.tsx (similar structure)
- components/real-estate/crm/contacts/ContactsClient.tsx (data fetching pattern)

Verification:
- Component compiles with zero TypeScript errors
- Data fetches successfully from database
- Filters work correctly on real data
- Stats display correct aggregations
- Empty state shows when no data
- Loading state displays during fetch
```

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Real data fetched from reid_ai_profiles table
- [ ] Stats calculated from real data
- [ ] Filters work on fetched data
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Outdated comments removed

- Add proper error handling with try/catch
- Add empty state message when no reports exist
- Maintain existing download/delete handlers (show "coming soon" toast for now)
- Remove outdated "skeleton module" comment

Data Fetching Pattern:
- Use existing getMarketReports() Server Action
- Call in loadReports() function
- Handle loading, error, and empty states
- No filters needed initially (fetch all for org)

Security:
- getMarketReports() already filters by organizationId
- RBAC already checked in queries file
- No additional security checks needed

Follow patterns from:
- components/real-estate/reid/ai-profiles/AIProfilesClient.tsx (same module)
- components/real-estate/workspace/document-list.tsx (similar data fetching)

Verification:
- Component compiles with zero TypeScript errors
- Data fetches successfully from market_reports table

Include variety:
- Schedule E for rental income (2+ reports)
- Form 1040 summaries (2+ reports)
- Expense categorization reports
- Year-end tax summaries
- Q1-Q4 quarterly reports for 2024
- Mix of completed and generating states
- Some with QuickBooks sync, some without

Financial Data Ranges:
- total_income: $25,000 - $250,000
- total_expenses: $10,000 - $100,000
- total_deductions: $5,000 - $50,000
- Realistic ratios (expenses < income)

Script Structure:
```typescript
import { prisma } from '@/lib/database/prisma';

export async function seedTaxReports() {
  console.log('Seeding tax_reports...');

  const reports = [
    // 10-12 report objects...
  ];

  for (const report of reports) {
    await prisma.tax_reports.create({ data: report });
  }

  console.log(`‚úÖ Seeded ${reports.length} tax reports`);
}
```

Database:
- Read prisma/SCHEMA-MODELS.md lines 2506-2564 for field reference
- Use TaxReportType enum values
- Use TaxReportStatus enum values
- Use valid organization_id and user_id
- Decimal fields need proper format

Verification:
- Script runs without errors
- All 10-12 records created successfully
- Data displays correctly in Expense/Tax Reports page
- Stats calculate correctly (total, by year, by status)
- Financial data displays properly
```

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Seed script created with 10-12 reports
- [ ] Variety of report types and years
- [ ] Realistic financial data
- [ ] Script executes successfully
- [ ] Data appears in UI correctly

## üìä Progress Tracking

Update this section as tasks are completed:

```
‚úÖ = Complete
üîÑ = In Progress
‚è≥ = Ready
‚ùå = Blocked

Task 1: ‚è≥ Create reid_ai_profiles queries
Task 2: ‚è≥ Update AIProfilesClient
Task 3: ‚è≥ Update ReportsClient
Task 4: ‚è≥ Create schools queries
Task 5: ‚è≥ Update SchoolsClient
Task 6: ‚è≥ Update Expense/Tax Reports
Task 7: ‚è≥ Remove outdated comments
Task 8: ‚è≥ Create AI profiles seed data
Task 9: ‚è≥ Create reports seed data
Task 10: ‚è≥ Create schools seed data
Task 11: ‚è≥ Create tax reports seed data
Task 12: ‚è≥ Final verification
```

---

## üéØ Execution Strategy

### Sequential Execution (Recommended)
Tasks should be executed in order (1 ‚Üí 12) because:
- Tasks 2-3 depend on queries from Task 1
- Task 5 depends on queries from Task 4
- Tasks 8-11 (seed data) depend on queries being created
- Task 12 (verification) requires all previous tasks complete

### Parallel Execution (Alternative)
If using parallel execution:
- Group A: Tasks 1, 4, 6 (query creation)
- Group B: Tasks 2, 3, 5 (client updates) - after Group A
- Group C: Tasks 8, 9, 10, 11 (seed data) - after Group A
- Group D: Task 7 (comments) - anytime
- Group E: Task 12 (verification) - after all others

### Quality Gates
After every 3-4 tasks, run mini-verification:
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit && npm run lint
```

Proceed only if checks pass.

## üìù Notes

- All tasks follow patterns from `.claude/agents/single-agent-usage-guide.md`
- Security requirements enforced: RBAC + Multi-tenancy + Input validation
- Database workflow optimized: Local docs (99% token savings vs MCP)
- Each task includes verification requirements and success criteria
- Agent will provide execution reports after each task

**Ready to delegate tasks one by one to `strive-agent-universal`**
