# The Strive Tech AI Agent Workflow System

# Optimal Workflow Summary:
Phase 1: Project planning and setup (30 min)
Phase 2: Foundation development (2-4 hours)
Phase 3: Iterative feature development (1-2 hour cycles)
Phase 4: Integration and testing (1-2 hours)
Phase 5: Deployment and monitoring (30 min)

# Agent Collaboration Matrix:
- UI/UX ↔ Frontend: Design implementation
- Frontend ↔ Backend: API integration
- Backend ↔ Database: Data layer optimization
- DevOps: Infrastructure for all agents
- Documentation: Process tracking for all agents
- Main Claude Code: Strategic coordination and quality oversight for all agents

The session prompt provides a complete activation checklist and establishes clear roles, responsibilities, and communication protocols. Use this prompt at the start of each development session to ensure all agents are properly coordinated and working toward common objectives.

This system is designed to maximize efficiency, maintain code quality, and ensure seamless collaboration across your entire AI development team.
