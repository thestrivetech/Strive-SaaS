---

### Phase 4: Conversational Intelligence ‚úÖ

**Files Created:**
- `lib/ai/follow-up-generator.ts` - Context-aware follow-up questions
- `lib/services/conversation-memory.ts` - Question repetition prevention

**Follow-Up Generation:**

Detects conversation stage and generates appropriate questions:

| Stage | Example Questions |
|-------|------------------|
| **Discovery** (first 2 msgs) | "What's bringing you to the market?", "How soon are you hoping to move?" |
| **Qualifying** (missing info) | "What area are you looking in?", "What's your maximum budget?" |
| **Search Results** (just showed props) | "Which of these homes catches your eye?", "Would you like to schedule showings?" |
| **Post-Search** (after viewing) | "Were any close to what you're looking for?", "Should I search with different criteria?" |
| **Closing** (ready for action) | "Would you like to schedule a showing?", "What's the best way to reach you?" |

**Memory System:**
- Tracks questions already asked
- Fuzzy matching to detect similar questions (70% similarity threshold)
- Tracks topics discussed
- Records properties viewed/favorited
- Extracts user mentions (concerns, preferences, dislikes)
- Provides context guidance for AI ("DO NOT REPEAT these questions...")

**Example:**
```
User: "I'm looking in Nashville for $700k"
Memory: { location: "Nashville", maxPrice: 700000 }

Later...
User: "What was my budget again?"
Sai: "You mentioned $700k for Nashville! [continues...]"
(Does NOT re-ask about location)
```

### Phase 5: Appointment & Agent Handoff ‚úÖ

**Files Created:**
- `lib/services/appointment-service.ts` - Showing appointment system
- `lib/services/agent-handoff.ts` - Human agent transfer logic

**Appointment Features:**
- Natural language date parsing:
  - "tomorrow" ‚Üí Next day at 10 AM
  - "next week" ‚Üí 7 days ahead
  - "this weekend" / "Saturday" ‚Üí Next Saturday
  - "12/25" ‚Üí Specific date parsing
- Suggested time slots (10 AM, 11 AM, 2 PM, 3 PM, 4 PM)
- Creates appointment in `appointments` table
- Assigns agent (best available)
- Confirmation message with date/time/agent

**Agent Handoff Triggers:**

| Trigger | Detection | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **User Frustration** | Keywords: "speak to person", "human", "agent", "frustrated" | "I want to talk to someone" |
| **Complex Question** | Keywords: "legal", "contract", "mortgage", "financing", "HOA" | "What are closing costs?" |
| **High-Value Lead** | Score ‚â•80 + viewed 3+ properties | Auto-suggest handoff |
| **Long Conversation** | 20+ messages (going in circles) | Auto-suggest agent |

**Handoff Process:**
1. Detect trigger condition
2. Find best agent:
   - Priority 1: Location expertise (matching user's search area)
   - Priority 2: Lowest active lead count (round-robin)
   - Priority 3: Any admin user
3. Build conversation transcript and lead summary
4. Create handoff activity in `activities` table
5. Update lead status ‚Üí CONTACTED
6. Assign lead to agent
7. Show user agent info and estimated response time

**Example Activity Created:**
```
Type: CALL
Title: "Chatbot Handoff: complex_question"
Description:
  ## üìã Lead Summary
  **Name:** John Doe
  **Email:** john@example.com
  **Lead Score:** HOT (75 points)

  ### üè† Property Preferences:
  - Location: Nashville, TN
  - Max Budget: $700,000
  - Bedrooms: 3+
  - Bathrooms: 2+
  - Must-Haves: pool, backyard

  ## üí¨ Conversation Transcript
  [Full conversation history]

  **User's Last Message:** "What are closing costs in Tennessee?"
```

## üîß Technical Architecture

### AI Models Used

| Model | Use Case | Provider | Speed |
|-------|----------|----------|-------|
| **Llama 3.3 70B Versatile** | Data extraction, follow-ups | Groq | ‚ö° Ultra-fast |
| **GPT-4 Turbo** | Complex conversations (paid tier) | OpenRouter | üöÄ Fast |
| **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** | Premium conversations | OpenRouter | üéØ Accurate |

### Data Flow

```
User Message
    ‚Üì
AI Data Extraction (Groq Llama 3.3)
    ‚Üì
Merge with Session State (in-memory cache)
    ‚Üì
Check Conversation Memory (prevent repetition)
    ‚Üì
Build Context-Aware System Prompt
    ‚Üì
[if minimum criteria met] ‚Üí Property Search (RentCast)
    ‚Üì
Match & Score Properties (11-category algorithm)
    ‚Üì
Stream Response to User (SSE)
    ‚Üì
Sync to CRM (Prisma ‚Üí Supabase)
    ‚Üì
Log Activity
```

### Session State Management

**Development:** In-memory Map cache
```typescript
const sessionStateCache = new Map<string, PropertyPreferences>();
```

**Production TODO:** Migrate to Redis
```typescript
// Planned:
await redis.set(`session:${sessionId}`, JSON.stringify(preferences), 'EX', 3600);
```

### Minimum Search Criteria Logic

**Old Behavior:** Required 4 fields (location, budget, bedrooms, propertyType)

**New Behavior:** Only 2 required (location + budget)
```typescript
function hasMinimumSearchCriteria(prefs: PropertyPreferences): boolean {
  return !!(prefs.location && prefs.maxPrice);
}

// Smart defaults applied:
const searchParams = {
  location: prefs.location,
  maxPrice: prefs.maxPrice,
  minBedrooms: prefs.minBedrooms || 2,  // Default
  minBathrooms: prefs.minBathrooms || 1, // Default
  mustHaveFeatures: prefs.mustHaveFeatures || [],
  propertyType: prefs.propertyType, // Optional
};
```

## üéØ Key Achievements

### Natural Conversation ‚úÖ

**Before:**
```
Bot: "Please enter your location"
User: "Nashville"
Bot: "Please enter your budget"
User: "$700,000"
Bot: "Please enter number of bedrooms"
User: "3"
```

**After:**
```
User: "Hi, I am looking for houses!"
Sai: "Hi there! I'd love to help you find your perfect home! üè°
      What area are you looking in and what is your budget range?"
User: "Nashville, TN and $700,000"
Sai: "Nashville is an amazing city! Great choice! üòä
      How many bedrooms and bathrooms are you looking for?"
User: "3 bed 2 bath with a pool"
Sai: "Perfect! Love it! [triggers search]"
```

### Intelligent Extraction ‚úÖ

| User Input | Fields Extracted |
|-----------|-----------------|
| "Nashville, TN and $700,000" | location, maxPrice (2 fields) |
| "3 bed 2 bath with pool" | minBedrooms, minBathrooms, features (3 fields) |
| "4 bedroom house in Memphis with backyard and garage for under $400k" | bedrooms, location, features (2), maxPrice (5 fields) |
| "$1.2M budget, Brentwood area, must have pool" | maxPrice, location, features (3 fields) |

### CRM Auto-Save ‚úÖ

**Every conversation automatically creates:**
1. Lead record with chatbot session ID
2. Property preferences in custom_fields JSON
3. Calculated lead score (0-100+ points)
4. Activity logs for each message
5. Property search activities
6. Showing request appointments

### Property Matching ‚úÖ

**Comprehensive scoring across 11 categories:**
- Price positioning (not just "under budget")
- Extra bedrooms/bathrooms valued
- Must-have features enforced (heavy penalty if missing)
- Market timing (fresh listings preferred)
- Condition & renovations
- School quality
- Price per sqft value
- Lot size
- Overall: ~200 point maximum, converted to percentage

**Result:** Top 5 properties sorted by relevance, not just price.

### Conversation Memory ‚úÖ

**Prevents frustrating repetition:**
- Remembers all user answers
- Detects similar questions (70% threshold)
- Tracks topics discussed
- References earlier context

**Example:**
```
Sai: "What area are you looking in?"
User: "Nashville"
[10 messages later...]
User: "Can you remind me what we discussed?"
Sai: "Of course! You're looking in Nashville with a $700k budget for a 3 bed 2 bath with a pool..."
```

### Agent Handoff ‚úÖ

**Intelligent routing:**
- Auto-detects when user needs human help
- Finds agent with Nashville expertise (if user searching Nashville)
- Falls back to round-robin by workload
- Provides full conversation transcript
- Estimated response time ("within 30 minutes", "within 2 hours")
