## üéØ Phase 1: Intent Classification

### Step 1.1: Create Intent Types

**File:** `lib/ai/intent-types.ts`

```typescript
export type QueryIntent =
  | 'PROPERTY_SEARCH'      // "Show me homes in Nashville under $500k"
  | 'AREA_QUESTION'        // "What's East Nashville like?"
  | 'MARKET_QUESTION'      // "Is $500k enough for Nashville?"
  | 'PROCESS_QUESTION'     // "What are closing costs in TN?"
  | 'GENERAL_CHAT';        // "Hi, can you help me?"

export interface IntentClassification {
  intent: QueryIntent;
  confidence: number; // 0-1
  reasoning?: string; // Why this classification
  extractedEntities?: {
    location?: string;
    priceRange?: string;
    topic?: string;
  };
}

export interface IntentPattern {
  intent: QueryIntent;
  keywords: string[];
  patterns: RegExp[];
  examples: string[];
}
```

### Step 1.2: Implement Intent Classifier

**File:** `lib/ai/intent-classifier.ts`

```typescript

const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });

// Intent patterns for fast keyword matching

      'How much is a down payment?',
    ],
  },
  {
    intent: 'GENERAL_CHAT',
    keywords: ['hi', 'hello', 'help', 'thanks', 'yes', 'no', 'okay'],
    patterns: [
      /^(?:hi|hello|hey|greetings)/i,

## üìù Phase 4: Knowledge Base Population

### Step 4.1: Create Seeding Script

**File:** `scripts/seed-knowledge-base.ts`

```typescript
import { KnowledgeService } from '@/lib/services/knowledge-service';

const NEIGHBORHOOD_KNOWLEDGE = [
  {
    category: 'neighborhoods' as const,
    industry: 'real-estate',
    title: 'East Nashville Overview',
    question: "What's East Nashville like?",
    answer: `East Nashville is one of Nashville's most vibrant and eclectic neighborhoods, known for its thriving arts scene, diverse dining options, and strong sense of community.

**Character & Vibe:**
East Nashville has evolved from an up-and-coming area to one of the city's most desirable neighborhoods. It's characterized by historic homes (many from the early 1900s), tree-lined streets, and a bohemian, artsy atmosphere. The neighborhood attracts young professionals, artists, musicians, and families who appreciate the authentic, laid-back vibe.

**Dining & Entertainment:**
Five Points is the heart of East Nashville's commercial district, packed with locally-owned restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and boutiques. Popular spots include Barista Parlor (coffee), The Pharmacy (upscale Southern), Mas Tacos (Mexican), and Mitchell Delicatessen (sandwiches). The neighborhood also hosts numerous live music venues and art galleries.

**Housing:**
Home styles range from charming bungalows and shotgun houses to renovated Victorians and new construction. Many homes feature original hardwood floors, front porches, and character details. Expect to pay $400k-$800k for renovated single-family homes, with some fixer-uppers available in the $300k-$400k range.

**Schools:**
East Nashville is served by Metro Nashville Public Schools. Popular options include Lockeland Elementary, which has strong parent involvement and decent ratings. Many families also choose private schools or magnet programs in other parts of the city.

**Walkability & Transportation:**
East Nashville scores high on walkability, especially around Five Points. You can easily walk to restaurants, shops, and parks. However, commuting to downtown or other parts of Nashville typically requires a car, as public transit options are limited.

**Best For:**
- Young professionals who want walkable urban living
- Artists and creatives
- Families who prioritize neighborhood character over school districts
- People who enjoy diverse dining and nightlife

**Considerations:**
- Home prices have risen significantly in recent years
- Parking can be challenging in commercial areas
- Some streets still have homes in need of renovation
- Metro school ratings vary (many families choose private schools)`,

    title: 'Green Hills Overview',
    question: "Tell me about Green Hills",
    answer: `Green Hills is an upscale neighborhood in southwest Nashville, known for luxury shopping, excellent schools, and family-friendly atmosphere.

**Character & Vibe:**
Green Hills is one of Nashville's most established and affluent neighborhoods. It offers a more suburban feel compared to downtown Nashville, with tree-lined streets, larger lots, and well-maintained homes. The area attracts families, professionals, and empty-nesters seeking a safe, convenient location with top-tier amenities.

**Shopping & Dining:**
The Mall at Green Hills is a major draw, featuring upscale retailers like Nordstrom, Louis Vuitton, and Apple. The surrounding area has numerous restaurants ranging from chains to local favorites. Nearby Hillsboro Village offers additional dining and boutique shopping with a more eclectic vibe.

**Housing:**
Homes in Green Hills range from mid-century modern to newer construction, with many properties featuring updated interiors, large yards, and mature landscaping. Expect to pay $600k-$2M+ for single-family homes, depending on size, condition, and exact location. Condos and townhomes are also available, starting around $400k.

**Schools:**
Green Hills is served by some of Metro Nashville's highest-rated public schools, including Julia Green Elementary and Hillsboro High School. These schools are a major draw for families and contribute to strong property values. Private school options are also nearby, including Harpeth Hall and Montgomery Bell Academy.

**Walkability & Transportation:**
While the commercial areas around the mall are walkable, Green Hills is primarily car-dependent for daily life. The neighborhood offers easy access to I-440 and I-65, making commutes to downtown Nashville or other parts of the city convenient (typically 10-15 minutes without traffic).

**Best For:**
- Families prioritizing excellent public schools
- Professionals wanting upscale suburban living near downtown
- Those who value convenience and amenities
- Buyers seeking strong property value retention

**Considerations:**
- Higher price point compared to other Nashville neighborhoods
- Can feel more corporate/less bohemian than East Nashville or Germantown
- Traffic around the mall area can be heavy, especially during holidays
- Less nightlife compared to downtown or East Nashville`,

    category: 'market' as const,
    industry: 'real-estate',
    title: 'Nashville Market Overview 2024-2025',
    question: "How's the Nashville real estate market?",
    answer: `Nashville's real estate market has evolved significantly in recent years, transitioning from a white-hot seller's market to a more balanced environment.

**Current Market Conditions (2024-2025):**
After years of rapid appreciation, Nashville's market has moderated. Home prices are still high by historical standards, but the frenzied bidding wars of 2020-2022 have largely subsided. Homes are staying on the market longer (30-45 days average), and buyers have more negotiating power than they did 2-3 years ago.

**Pricing Trends:**
- Median home price: ~$450k (varies significantly by neighborhood)
- Year-over-year appreciation: 2-4% (down from 15-20% in 2021-2022)
- Inventory: Gradually increasing but still below pre-pandemic levels
- Days on market: 30-45 days (up from 7-10 days in peak market)

**Buyer vs Seller Market:**
The market is currently balanced to slightly favoring buyers, depending on price point and location:
- Under $400k: Still competitive with multiple offers common
- $400k-$800k: Balanced market, some negotiation possible
- $800k-$1.5M: Slight buyer's market, properties may sit longer
- $1.5M+: Definitely buyer's market, significant negotiation leverage

**Interest Rate Impact:**
Mortgage rates (currently 6.5-7.5%) have significantly impacted affordability. Many buyers who could have afforded $600k homes at 3% rates are now looking in the $450k-$500k range. This has created more competition in the entry-level and mid-tier markets.

**Regional Variations:**
- East Nashville: Still hot, limited inventory, 5-10% annual appreciation
- Green Hills: Stable, strong demand from families, 3-5% appreciation
- The Gulch/Downtown: Softening, especially for condos, 0-2% appreciation
- Suburbs (Brentwood, Franklin): Stable to slight decline in some areas

**Forecast for Next 12-24 Months:**
Most economists predict Nashville's market will remain stable with modest appreciation (2-5% annually). The combination of strong job growth, population inflow, and limited new construction should support prices. However, if interest rates drop significantly, demand could spike again.

**Best Time to Buy:**
Now is actually a good time for buyers who can afford current interest rates. You have negotiating power, less competition, and the ability to refinance later if rates drop. Waiting for rate drops may mean returning to a more competitive market.`,

    title: 'Budget Guide for Nashville',
    question: 'What can I get for $500k in Nashville?',
    answer: `With a $500k budget in Nashville, you're in a sweet spot that opens up many options, though expectations should be calibrated to the neighborhood you're targeting.

**What $500k Gets You:**

**In Prime Urban Neighborhoods (East Nashville, Germantown, 12 South):**
- 2-3 bedroom, 1,200-1,800 sq ft home
- Likely a renovated older home (1920s-1960s era)
- Or a smaller new construction townhome
- Walkable to restaurants, shops, and entertainment
- May need some updates or cosmetic work
- Typically smaller lots (under 0.15 acres)

**In Family-Oriented Neighborhoods (Sylvan Park, Belmont-Hillsboro):**
- 3-4 bedroom, 1,800-2,200 sq ft home
- Mix of renovated older homes and 1980s-2000s construction
- Larger lots (0.15-0.25 acres)
- Good schools nearby
- More move-in ready condition
- Less walkability but family-friendly

**In Suburbs (Donelson, Hermitage, Antioch):**
- 3-4 bedroom, 2,000-2,500 sq ft home
- Newer construction (2000s-2020s)
- Larger lots (0.25+ acres)
- More modern layouts and amenities
- Better school access
- Car-dependent but more space

**What $500k WON'T Get You:**
- Fully renovated large home in Green Hills, Belle Meade, or The Gulch
- New construction single-family home in prime East Nashville
- Luxury finishes throughout (expect mid-grade)
- Large yard (over 0.25 acres) in urban neighborhoods
- Pool (rare at this price point in Nashville)

**Realistic Expectations:**
At $500k, prioritize what matters most:
- Location over size? ‚Üí Choose East Nashville, 12 South (smaller home)
- Space and schools? ‚Üí Choose Sylvan Park, Belmont-Hillsboro
- Modern and move-in ready? ‚Üí Choose suburbs (Donelson, Mt. Juliet)

**Pro Tips:**
1. Budget an additional $20k-$50k for updates/repairs unless buying new construction
2. Expect to compromise on at least one major factor (location, size, or condition)
3. Consider homes just listed or slightly over-priced that you can negotiate down
4. Homes under $500k will likely have multiple offers, so have pre-approval ready
5. If you can stretch to $525k-$550k, options expand significantly

**Market Reality:**
Five years ago, $500k would have gotten you significantly more. Today, it's a solid mid-tier budget that requires strategic shopping and clear priorities.`,

    title: 'Tennessee Closing Costs Guide',
    question: 'What are closing costs in Tennessee?',
    answer: `Closing costs in Tennessee typically range from 2-5% of the home's purchase price, paid by the buyer at the closing table. Understanding these costs helps you budget accurately for your home purchase.

**Typical Closing Costs Breakdown (on a $400k home):**

**Lender Fees ($3,000-$5,000):**
- Origination fee: 0.5-1% of loan ($2,000-$4,000)
- Application fee: $300-$500
- Underwriting fee: $400-$800
- Credit report: $25-$50
- Appraisal: $400-$600
- Flood certification: $15-$25

**Title & Escrow ($2,500-$4,000):**
- Title search: $200-$400
- Title insurance (lender's): $800-$1,200
- Title insurance (owner's - optional but recommended): $1,000-$1,500
- Escrow/closing fee: $500-$800
- Recording fees: $100-$200

**Prepaid Items ($3,000-$6,000):**
- Homeowners insurance (1 year): $1,200-$2,000
- Property taxes (2-6 months): $1,500-$3,000
- Mortgage interest (prorated to end of month): $500-$1,000
- HOA fees (if applicable): Varies

**Other Costs ($500-$1,500):**
- Home inspection: $400-$600
- Survey: $300-$500
- HOA transfer fees: $100-$300
- Courier fees: $50-$100

**TOTAL ESTIMATE:**
- $400k home: $8,000-$16,000 in closing costs
- $500k home: $10,000-$20,000 in closing costs
- $600k home: $12,000-$24,000 in closing costs

**Tennessee-Specific Considerations:**

1. **Recordation Tax:** Tennessee does not have a state-level mortgage tax or recordation tax (unlike some states like New York). This saves buyers money!

2. **Title Insurance:** Tennessee is a "negotiated rate" state for title insurance, meaning you can shop around for better prices. Don't just accept the first quote.

3. **Property Transfer Tax:** Tennessee has no transfer tax for buyers. Sellers pay $0.37 per $100 of the sales price (this is NOT your responsibility as a buyer).

4. **Escrow Accounts:** Tennessee requires lenders to collect property taxes and insurance into escrow accounts (included in your monthly payment).

**Ways to Reduce Closing Costs:**

1. **Shop for services:** You can choose your own title company, insurance provider, and home inspector (competition saves money).

2. **Negotiate with seller:** In a buyer's market, you can ask the seller to contribute $5,000-$10,000 toward your closing costs (called "seller concessions").

3. **Compare lenders:** Lender fees vary widely. Get quotes from at least 3 lenders and compare Loan Estimates side-by-side.

4. **Close at month-end:** Closing near the end of the month reduces prepaid interest (you pay interest from closing date to end of month).

5. **Waive owner's title insurance:** While not recommended, this saves $1,000-$1,500. However, it's risky if title issues arise later.

**Hidden Costs to Budget For:**

Don't forget these additional costs NOT included in closing:
- Moving costs: $500-$3,000
- Immediate repairs/updates: $2,000-$10,000
- New furniture/appliances: $3,000-$10,000
- Utility deposits: $200-$500
- HOA fees: $100-$500/month (if applicable)

**Bottom Line:**
Budget 2.5-3% of your home's purchase price for closing costs. If buying a $500k home with 20% down ($100k), expect to bring about $110,000-$115,000 to closing ($100k down payment + $10k-$15k closing costs).`,
    shortAnswer: "Tennessee closing costs are typically 2-5% of home price ($8k-$20k on a $400-$500k home). Includes lender fees, title insurance, prepaid taxes/insurance. TN has no transfer tax for buyers, which saves money!",

    title: 'Home Buying Process Timeline',
    question: 'What is the home buying process?',
    answer: `The home buying process in Tennessee typically takes 30-60 days from offer acceptance to closing, though getting pre-approved and finding the right home can take weeks or months beforehand.

**PHASE 1: Pre-Shopping Preparation (2-4 weeks)**

**Week 1-2: Financial Preparation**
1. Check your credit score (aim for 680+ for best rates)
2. Review your budget and determine comfortable monthly payment
3. Save for down payment (3-20%) + closing costs (2-5%) + emergency fund
4. Gather financial documents: 2 years tax returns, 2 months pay stubs, 2 months bank statements

**Week 2-4: Get Pre-Approved**
5. Contact 2-3 lenders and compare Loan Estimates
6. Submit application and documentation
7. Receive pre-approval letter (shows sellers you're serious)
8. Connect with a buyer's agent (free for buyers - seller pays commission)

**PHASE 2: Home Search (2-8 weeks, highly variable)**

**Weeks 1-8: Active Shopping**
9. Define your must-haves vs nice-to-haves
10. Tour homes with your agent (plan for 8-15 showings minimum)
11. Research neighborhoods, schools, commutes
12. Attend open houses on weekends
13. Get comfortable with what's available in your price range

**When You Find "The One":**
14. Do a second showing (bring family, inspect more carefully)
15. Check comparable sales (your agent does this)
16. Decide on offer price and strategy

**PHASE 3: Offer to Contract (1-3 days)**

**Day 1: Submit Offer**
17. Agent writes up offer with your proposed price, terms, contingencies
18. Include earnest money deposit (typically $1,000-$5,000)
19. Set deadlines: inspection (7-10 days), appraisal (15 days), financing (21 days), closing (30-45 days)
20. Submit pre-approval letter and offer

**Days 1-3: Negotiation**
21. Seller responds (accept, reject, or counter)
22. Negotiate back-and-forth on price, closing date, repairs, contingencies
23. Once agreed, both parties sign ‚Üí You're under contract!

**PHASE 4: Due Diligence (10-14 days)**

**Days 1-7: Home Inspection**
24. Hire licensed home inspector ($400-$600)
25. Attend inspection (highly recommended)
26. Review inspection report (typically 40-60 pages)
27. Decide what to ask seller to repair

**Days 7-10: Inspection Negotiation**
28. Request repairs or credits via "inspection objection"
29. Seller responds (agree to fix, offer credit, or refuse)
30. Negotiate resolution or walk away (get earnest money back if within inspection period)

**Days 10-14: Appraisal**
31. Lender orders appraisal ($400-$600, paid by you)
32. Appraiser visits property and assesses value
33. Receive appraisal report
34. If appraisal comes in low, negotiate with seller or bring more cash

**PHASE 5: Financing & Final Steps (15-25 days)**

**Days 15-25: Loan Processing**
35. Lender reviews your finances in detail
36. Provide any additional requested documents
37. Loan goes to underwriting for final approval
38. Underwriter may request more info (be responsive!)
39. Receive "clear to close" (typically 3-5 days before closing)

**Days 20-25: Pre-Closing Tasks**
40. Purchase homeowners insurance (required by lender)
41. Set up utilities (electric, gas, water, internet)
42. Hire movers or rent truck
43. Do final walk-through (24-48 hours before closing)
44. Review Closing Disclosure (shows exact closing costs)
45. Wire down payment + closing costs to title company

**PHASE 6: Closing Day! (Day 30-45)**

**Closing Day:**
46. Meet at title company with your agent and signing documents
47. Review and sign ~100 pages of paperwork (takes 30-90 minutes)
48. Wire or bring cashier's check for remaining funds
49. Receive keys to your new home!
50. Celebrate! üéâ

**Post-Closing:**
51. Update mailing address with USPS, banks, employers
52. File homestead exemption (if applicable) for property tax reduction
53. Keep copies of all closing documents (especially closing disclosure and deed)
54. Schedule any immediate repairs or updates

**Common Timeline Delays:**
- Appraisal delays: 1-2 weeks (appraiser shortage)
- Repair negotiations: 3-7 days
- Underwriting issues: 1-2 weeks (if documents missing)
- Seller delays: Variable (moving, buying another home, etc.)

**Tips for a Smooth Process:**
1. Respond quickly to lender requests (don't delay your own closing)
2. Don't make major purchases or open new credit cards (affects loan approval)
3. Keep your down payment funds in one account (easier to document)
4. Stay in close contact with your agent and lender
5. Be prepared for things to go wrong (and have backup plans)

**Average Timeline:**
- Fast closing: 21-30 days (cash buyers or strong financing)
- Typical closing: 30-45 days
- Slow closing: 45-60+ days (complex financing, repair negotiations, appraisal issues)`,

## ‚úÖ Phase 5: Testing & Validation

### Step 5.1: Create Integration Tests

**File:** `__tests__/integration/knowledge-rag.test.ts`

```typescript

### Step 5.2: Manual Testing Checklist

Create a test conversation session:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start dev server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Test queries
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "What'\''s East Nashville like?"}
    ],
    "industry": "real-estate",
    "sessionId": "test-123"
  }'
```

**Test Cases:**
1. ‚úÖ Property search: "Show me homes in Nashville under $500k"
2. ‚úÖ Area question: "What's East Nashville like?"
3. ‚úÖ Market question: "Is $500k enough?"
4. ‚úÖ Process question: "What are closing costs?"
5. ‚úÖ General chat: "Hi, can you help me?"
6. ‚úÖ Mixed intent: "I want to buy in East Nashville, what's it like?"

**Expected Behavior:**
- Property search ‚Üí No RAG, uses extraction flow
- Knowledge questions ‚Üí RAG retrieval, knowledge injected into prompt
- General chat ‚Üí No RAG, conversational response
- Log output should show intent classification and knowledge retrieval

---

## üìä Phase 6: Monitoring & Optimization

### Step 6.1: Add Analytics Tracking

**File:** `lib/analytics/knowledge-analytics.ts`

```typescript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY!
);

export interface KnowledgeAnalytics {
  totalSearches: number;
  searchesByCategory: Record<string, number>;
  averageSimilarityScore: number;
  topQueries: Array<{ query: string; count: number }>;
  topViewedEntries: Array<{ title: string; views: number; helpfulRatio: number }>;
  lowPerformingEntries: Array<{ title: string; views: number; helpfulRatio: number }>;
}

export async function getKnowledgeAnalytics(
  startDate: Date,
  endDate: Date
): Promise<KnowledgeAnalytics> {
  // Query knowledge_entries for analytics
  const { data: entries } = await supabase
    .from('knowledge_entries')
    .select('*')
    .order('view_count', { ascending: false })
    .limit(10);

  // Calculate helpful ratios
  const topViewedEntries = entries?.map(e => ({
    title: e.title,
    views: e.view_count,
    helpfulRatio: e.view_count > 0 ? e.helpful_count / e.view_count : 0,
  })) || [];

  // Find low-performing entries (low helpful ratio)
  const lowPerforming = topViewedEntries
    .filter(e => e.views > 10 && e.helpfulRatio < 0.3)
    .sort((a, b) => a.helpfulRatio - b.helpfulRatio);

  return {
    totalSearches: 0, // Track in separate search log table
    searchesByCategory: {
      neighborhoods: 0,
      market: 0,
      process: 0,
    },
    averageSimilarityScore: 0,
    topQueries: [],
    topViewedEntries,
    lowPerformingEntries: lowPerforming,
  };
}
```

### Step 6.2: Dashboard for Knowledge Quality

Create an admin endpoint to monitor knowledge quality:

**File:** `app/api/admin/knowledge-analytics/route.ts`

```typescript
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { getKnowledgeAnalytics } from '@/lib/analytics/knowledge-analytics';

export async function GET(req: NextRequest) {
  // TODO: Add admin auth check

  const startDate = new Date(Date.now() - 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000); // 30 days ago
  const endDate = new Date();

  const analytics = await getKnowledgeAnalytics(startDate, endDate);

  return NextResponse.json(analytics);
}
```

Access at: `http://localhost:3000/api/admin/knowledge-analytics`

### Step 6.3: Continuous Improvement Process

**Weekly Review:**
1. Check low-performing knowledge entries (low helpful ratio)
2. Review user feedback text
3. Identify missing knowledge gaps (queries with no results)
4. Update or add new knowledge entries

**Monthly Review:**
1. Analyze intent classification accuracy
2. Review similarity score distributions
3. Add new neighborhoods/markets as needed
4. Remove outdated information (old market data)
