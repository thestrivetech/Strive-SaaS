# Property Photos Solution - MVP Implementation

## üéØ What We Implemented

**Stock Placeholder Images** for property listings - FREE solution for MVP!

### ‚úÖ Features Implemented

1. **High-Quality Unsplash Images**
   - Professional real estate photography
   - Property-type specific images (single-family, condo, townhouse, multi-family)
   - 3-4 images per property
   - 1200px wide, optimized quality (q=80)

2. **Transparent User Experience**
   - Small "Stock Photo" badge on images (bottom-right corner)
   - Badge also appears in photo gallery modal
   - Users know these are placeholders

3. **Future-Proof Design**
   - Code checks for real RentCast photos first
   - If RentCast adds photos later, they'll automatically be used
   - Easy to swap to other photo sources

## üí∞ Cost Analysis

### Current Solution: $0/month ‚úÖ
- Using royalty-free Unsplash images
- No API costs
- Unlimited usage

### Future Options (when ready to upgrade)

**Option 1: Google Street View API**
- Cost: $7 per 1,000 images
- Shows actual property location
- Simple to implement

**Option 2: Premium MLS Photo APIs**
- Cost: $500-2,000/month + revenue share
- Real interior/exterior listing photos
- Requires partnership agreements

## üöÄ How It Works

```typescript
// In rentcast-service.ts
private static transformListing(listing: any): Property {
  // Try to use real photos first (if RentCast provides them)
  const images = listing.photos && listing.photos.length > 0
    ? listing.photos.map((p: any) => p.href || p.url)
    : this.getPlaceholderImages(listing.propertyType); // Fallback to stock

  // ... rest of transformation
}
```

### Image Selection Logic
1. Check if property type is single-family, condo, townhouse, or multi-family
2. Select appropriate image set from curated Unsplash collection
3. Return 3-4 random images from that set
4. Each property gets consistent but varied imagery

## üì∏ Image Sources

All images are from Unsplash (royalty-free, commercial use allowed):

### Single-Family Homes (4 images)
- Modern house exterior
- Beautiful home with landscaping
- House with garden
- Contemporary architecture

### Condos (3 images)

- Upscale apartment building

### Townhouses (3 images)

### Multi-Family (3 images)

## üîÑ Future Migration Path

When you're ready to add real photos:

   ```typescript
   // Add to transformListing()
   const streetViewUrl = `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/streetview?size=1200x800&location=${address}&key=${API_KEY}`;
   images.push(streetViewUrl);
   ```

2. **Premium: MLS Photo Integration**
   - Partner with Zillow/Realtor.com API
   - Replace `getPlaceholderImages()` with MLS photo fetch
   - Keep fallback to stock photos
