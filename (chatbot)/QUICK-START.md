## ⚡ Test It Right Now (30 seconds)

### Step 1: Open Chatbot
```
Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/full
```

### Step 2: Have This Conversation

```
You: "Hi, I am looking for houses!"

Sai: "Hi there! I'd love to help you find your perfect home! 🏡
      What area are you looking in and what is your budget range?"

You: "Nashville, TN and $700,000"

Sai: "Nashville is an amazing city! Great choice! 😊
      How many bedrooms and bathrooms are you looking for?"

You: "3 bed 2 bath with a pool"

Sai: [Should trigger property search automatically]
     [Property cards should appear showing top 5 matches]
```

### Step 3: Verify These Work

**On Each Property Card:**
- [ ] Click "📸 View Photos" → Photo gallery opens
- [ ] Click ❤️ heart icon → Favorites the property
- [ ] Click "📅 Schedule Tour" → Creates appointment
- [ ] Check match percentage badge (should be color-coded)

---

## ✅ What Got Built

### 1. Natural Conversation (Phase 1)
- Sai talks like a real estate agent (warm, enthusiastic, helpful)
- Extracts multiple fields from one message: "Nashville, $700k" → location + budget
- Never sounds robotic or form-like

### 2. CRM Integration (Phase 2)
- Every conversation automatically saves to CRM
- Lead scoring: COLD → WARM → HOT → QUALIFIED
- All preferences stored in database
- Activity logs for every message

### 3. Smart Property Search (Phase 3)
- Triggers with just location + budget (smart defaults for rest)
- 11-category matching algorithm (~200 points max)
- Match percentage on every property card
- Top 5 matches sorted by relevance

### 4. Conversation Intelligence (Phase 4)
- Remembers everything user says
- NEVER asks same question twice
- Context-aware follow-up questions
- References earlier conversation

### 5. Agent Handoff (Phase 5)
- Auto-detects when user needs human help
- Transfers with full conversation transcript
- Assigns best available agent
- Scheduled appointments system

## 🔍 Quick Verification

### Test Data Extraction
Try these messages and verify Sai extracts ALL fields:

```
"4 bedroom house in Memphis with backyard and garage for under $400k"
→ Should extract: location, bedrooms, 2 features, maxPrice

"$1.2M budget, Brentwood area, must have pool"
→ Should extract: maxPrice (1,200,000), location, features

"Looking for condos in Franklin, $500k max, 2 bed 2 bath"
→ Should extract: propertyType, location, maxPrice, bedrooms, bathrooms
```

### Test Memory
```
1. "I'm looking in Nashville for $700k"
2. "How many bedrooms?" → Answer something
3. Ask: "What was my location again?"
4. Sai should remember Nashville (not re-ask)
```

### Test Agent Handoff
```
Say: "I want to speak to a real person"
→ Should trigger agent handoff
→ Shows agent name, contact info, response time
```

## 📊 Check CRM Data

### Option 1: Prisma Studio
```bash
cd (chatbot)
npx prisma studio --schema=../shared/prisma/schema.prisma
```

**What to Check:**
- Table: `leads` → Find your session's lead
  - `custom_fields` should have all your preferences
  - `score` should be calculated (0-100+)
  - `status` should progress (NEW → WARM → HOT)
- Table: `activities` → See all your messages logged
- Table: `appointments` → See any showing requests

### Option 2: Platform Dashboard
```
Navigate to: http://localhost:3001 (if platform running)
Go to: CRM → Leads
Find: Lead with chatbot session ID
```
