 We now need to do a review to make sure that the design for this module and all of its
  dashboards/pages matches the main user dashboard. In doing this, we also need to make sure     
  that all functions and features are working properly for every part of this entire module.     
  Split everything up into phases and use the single agent guide in order to deploy the agent    
  in every phase to ensure high quality work is being done and no mistakes are being made ->     
  C:\Users\zochr\Desktop\GitHub\Strive-SaaS\.claude\agents\single-agent-usage-guide.md ->        
  Remember that we are using mock data at the moment to ensure everything works properly when I  
  go and test the local preview.
