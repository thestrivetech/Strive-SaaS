This file will be used to document all changes throughout the development of the website.

Each agent will have a designated space within this file to document their changes in full detail (the documentation agent will be the one to keep track of all changes made by each agent as the agents work in each session) - Please make sure to keep track of prior state and present state of each change that is made so we can rollback to something that was working in the past if whatever is implemented breaks the project. Use complete detailed documentation

This log is not for documenting new code, that's what the chat logs are for which is located here: C:\Users\zochr\Desktop\GitHub\Strive_Website_Replit\chat_logs
This change log is specifically for edits made to existing code or deletions. All edits and deletions of any code should be documented here and also mentioned within the specific agents chat log that did the editing / changing
