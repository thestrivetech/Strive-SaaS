# Session 3.3: Design Expense-Tax Schema

**Phase:** 3 - Full Feature Set
**Priority:** ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM
**Estimated Time:** 1.5 hours
**Agent:** `strive-agent-universal`

---

## ðŸŽ¯ OBJECTIVE

Design Expense & Tax module schema with 5 models for expense tracking, categorization, tax calculations, reporting, and receipt management.

---

## ðŸ“‹ TASK (CONDENSED)

**Design 5 Models:**

1. **expenses** - Expense records with amount, date, category, description
2. **expense_categories** - Predefined + custom categories (mileage, meals, office, marketing, etc.)
3. **tax_estimates** - Quarterly/annual tax estimates and calculations
4. **tax_reports** - Generated tax reports (1099, Schedule C, etc.)
5. **receipts** - Receipt uploads with OCR text extraction and storage URLs

**Key Requirements:**
- All models filter by `organization_id` (multi-tenancy)
- Receipts stored in Supabase Storage with RLS
- Integration with QuickBooks API (fields for external sync)
- Tax year tracking (fiscal year support)
- Mileage tracking (start/end locations, distance)
- Deduction categories (IRS-compliant)
- Receipt OCR data (JSON field for extracted text)

**Relationships:**
- Expense â†’ Category (many-to-one)
- Expense â†’ Receipt (one-to-many)
- Tax Estimate â†’ Expenses (aggregation)
- Tax Report â†’ Expenses (period-based)

**Output:** Complete schema design document

**DO NOT implement - design only**
