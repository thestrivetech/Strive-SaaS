@claude -> Please make sure that all mentioned notes below make sense align with current platform/website direction

Free trial for Sai platform (intelligent business platform) should be limited requests and cheaper models - Be transparent about this  - Offer each tier of user a more powerful model with more tools and capabilities

Offer basic dashboard to tier 1 users, more customized dashboard (industry specific) for tier 2, and tier 3 (enterprise) gets a fully customized dashboard for their specific company and workflows and tools

Role play which allows users to role play their specific roles: Sales, CEO (negotiations & PR), VP (conversation with their boss), etc. - This would be a really good tool to offer with Sai for intelligent business platform

Tiers -> Tier 0: Free with very limited usage and requests & generalized dashboard not specific to any industry or company (very basic dashboard), Tier 1: $299-$499  best for Solopreneurs & Startups with industry specific dashboard, Tier 2: $699-$1,000 best for SMEs & niched markets/industries or people who want accelerated growth & a dashboard that's specific to their business/company with access to workflow automations with limited requests, Tier 3: Enterprise - Custom pricing and best for businesses who need fully customized Sai and full Agentic workflows & teams (this could also be very helpful for start ups and solo entrepreneurs that need specific solutions and tools) this would allow people to gain unlimited access to usage and requests.

Super important to pre-prompt Sai or subagents to be critical and unbiased when doing reviews and or testing (this is important for internal use and for building certain agents or tools for business platform)

Secret weapon - AI evals: Where LLMs review a company and also to see if an LLM even knows about the existence of a company (could offer a SEO type service within this eval process) - Watch: https://youtu.be/TL527yTpxlk?si=DB6dfGrSo_3peSBj

Create “Investors” & “Partners” page on website -> make accessible on the Our Company page and put on home page

(not applicable to the project, just a user note) Create prompting techniques and keywords to use to achieve specific outcomes - Put in Strive drive (will be useful when building prompt engineer agent & other agents)

(not applicable to the project, just a user note) Joshy (Embur) -> Educates all businesses and people on how to use the platform

# Notes for pricing page

Do industry specific packages/bundles that have core dashboards and tools relevant to each dashboard.
    - Then have the tool marketplace where everyone can pick additional tools, dashboards, or add-ons (this will always be available for them to do in the tool marketplace inside of the SaaS app)

Tier layout: Tier 1 (starter - smaller agencies), Tier 2 (growth) - best for startups seeking accelerated growth, Tier 3 (elite) - best for enterprize and commercial agencies , Tier 4 (custom - complete customization and custom deals / company specific)
    - Custom = Takes them to the next page which is similar to the tool marketplace where they can customize their subscription package (have specialized bundles and pairings with tools and dashboards)
    - Best Value Banner on "Growth" tier & Most Popular banner on "Custom" tier
Tool Marketplace: Generlized AI business tools - 3 Tiers of tools which are filtered by industry
