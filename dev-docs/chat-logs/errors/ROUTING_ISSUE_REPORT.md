# Next.js 15 Route Groups Issue Report

**⚠️ STATUS: RESOLVED (2025-09-29)**

The issue was caused by incorrect project structure. Next.js 15 App Router requires an `app/` subdirectory within the project root. All App Router files (including route groups) must be inside this `app/` directory.

**Solution Implemented:** Created `app/app/` structure and moved all App Router files into it. Server now runs successfully with route groups working correctly.

---

## Original Problem Summary (RESOLVED)
Route groups using parentheses syntax `(auth)` and `(platform)` were not being recognized by Next.js 15.5.4, causing all pages within these groups to return 404 errors.

## Current State
- **Server Running:** http://localhost:3001 (with Turbopack)
- **Root Path (/):** Redirects to `/dashboard` ✅
- **Middleware:** Working correctly (redirects unauthenticated users) ✅
- **Regular Routes:** Working (e.g., `/test` page loads) ✅
- **Route Group Pages:** All return 404 ❌
  - `/auth/login` → 404
  - `/dashboard` → 404 (after redirect)
  - `/crm` → 404
  - `/projects` → 404
  - `/settings` → 404

## File Structure (OLD - WAS INCORRECT)
```
app/                         # THIS WAS THE PROJECT ROOT
├── (auth)/                  # Route group - Next.js couldn't find these!
│   └── login/page.tsx
├── (platform)/              # Route group - Next.js couldn't find these!
│   ├── dashboard/page.tsx
│   └── [other routes]
└── middleware.ts
```

## Correct File Structure (IMPLEMENTED)
```
app/                         # Next.js project root
├── app/                     # App Router directory (REQUIRED!)
│   ├── page.tsx            # Root page
│   ├── layout.tsx          # Root layout
│   ├── globals.css
│   ├── (platform)/         # Route group - NOW WORKING ✅
│   │   ├── dashboard/
│   │   └── [other routes]
│   └── api/
├── components/
├── lib/
├── middleware.ts
└── next.config.mjs
```

## What We've Tried
1. **Removed conflicting lockfiles:**
   - Deleted `C:/Users/zochr/pnpm-lock.yaml`
   - Deleted `app/web/package-lock.json`
   - Deleted `app/web/Strive-dashboard-MVP/project/package-lock.json`

2. **Fixed Tailwind CSS errors:**
   - Replaced `border-border` with `border` in multiple files
   - Fixed CSS variable references

3. **Configured Next.js root directory:**
   - Added `experimental.turbo.root` to `next.config.ts`

4. **Tested without Turbopack:**
   - Same issue occurs with regular webpack build
   - Route groups still not recognized

5. **Verified file structure:**
   - All files exist in correct locations
   - Permissions are correct
   - Files are valid TypeScript/React components

## Test Results
```bash
# Test that proves routes work without route groups:
cp -r "app/(auth)/login" app/auth-login
curl http://localhost:3001/auth-login  # Returns 200 ✅

# But the actual route group path fails:
curl http://localhost:3001/auth/login   # Returns 404 ❌
```

## Historical Context
- **Session 2:** Route groups were created but had issues with `@supabase/ssr` module resolution
- **Session 3:** Attempted to fix the module resolution, but route groups never actually worked
- **Current:** Module resolution fixed, but route groups still don't work

## Root Cause Analysis
This appears to be a bug or incompatibility with:
- Next.js 15.5.4's handling of route groups
- Possibly related to Windows file system path handling
- May be specific to the development environment setup

## Potential Solutions
1. **Remove Route Groups (Recommended for now):**
   - Move `(auth)/login` → `auth/login`
   - Move `(platform)/dashboard` → `dashboard`
   - Update middleware paths accordingly
   - This will get the app working immediately

2. **Debug Route Groups:**
   - Check if this is a known Next.js 15 issue
   - Try downgrading to Next.js 14
   - Check if Windows path separators are causing issues

3. **Alternative Structure:**
   - Use path prefixes instead of route groups
   - Create separate layout files for each section
   - Maintain logical separation without route groups

## Current Errors in Console
```
⚠ Warning: The config property `experimental.turbo` is deprecated
⚠ turbopack.root should be absolute
Error: Cannot apply unknown utility class `bg-background`
GET /auth/login 404
```

## Recommendation
Since route groups have never worked in this project and are blocking progress, recommend temporarily moving pages out of route groups to regular folders. This will allow immediate functionality while the route group issue can be investigated separately.

## Files to Update if Removing Route Groups
1. Move all pages from `(auth)/*` to `auth/*`
2. Move all pages from `(platform)/*` to root or a regular folder
3. Update `middleware.ts` to reflect new paths
4. Update any `Link` components or `router.push()` calls
5. Move layouts to appropriate locations

This is a blocking issue preventing the app from being usable. The authentication system, middleware, and components are all working correctly - only the route group recognition is failing.
