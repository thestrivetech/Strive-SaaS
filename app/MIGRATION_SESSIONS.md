# Single Next.js App Migration - Session Breakdown

## Overview
Convert from Vite/Next.js hybrid to unified Next.js app with route groups.
**Total time:** ~6.5 hours across 7 sessions

---

## Session 1: Backup & Platform Reorganization (45 min) ✅ COMPLETED

### Phases: 1, 2, 3

### Goals:
- ✅ Create migration branch
- ✅ Document current structure
- ✅ Reorganize platform/ into app/(platform)/
- ✅ Create route group structure (NO redundant app/app/)
- ✅ Archive old platform/ directory

### What Was Actually Done (2025-09-29):
```bash
# Created migration branch
git checkout -b feature/single-app-migration

# MOVED (not copied) all platform routes
mv platform/login app/(platform)/
mv platform/dashboard app/(platform)/
mv platform/crm app/(platform)/
mv platform/projects app/(platform)/
mv platform/ai app/(platform)/
mv platform/tools app/(platform)/
mv platform/settings app/(platform)/

# Moved layout, styles, API
mv platform/layout.tsx app/(platform)/
mv platform/page.tsx app/(platform)/
mv platform/globals.css app/
mv platform/favicon.ico app/
mv platform/api/* app/api/

# Archived old platform directory
mv platform platform-backup-OLD
```

### Deliverable: ✅
Clean app router structure with route groups:
```
app/                    # Next.js project root
├── app/                # App Router directory (Next.js requirement)
│   ├── (platform)/     # Platform routes (moved, not copied)
│   ├── (web)/          # Empty, ready for Session 2
│   ├── api/            # API routes
│   ├── page.tsx        # Root page (redirects to /platform/dashboard)
│   ├── layout.tsx      # Root layout
│   └── globals.css     # Global styles
├── components/
├── lib/
└── [config files]
```

### Important Corrections Made:
1. **Initial mistake:** Used `cp` (copy) instead of `mv` (move) - created duplicates
2. **User caught it:** Identified duplication issue immediately
3. **Second mistake:** Created redundant `app/app/` directory
4. **User caught it again:** "Why app/app/?" - Fixed by moving everything up one level
5. **Third mistake:** The "fix" in step 4 was wrong - Next.js REQUIRES app/app/ structure
6. **Final correction (2025-09-29):** Properly implemented app/app/ structure as required by Next.js 15 App Router
7. **Final result:** Proper Next.js structure with app/ subdirectory containing all App Router files

### Time Taken: 45 minutes
### Status: ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for Session 2
### Documentation: Full session log at `chat-logs/old-site-updates/session3.md`

- ✅ Move web components
- ✅ Extract shared UI

### Prompt:
```
Execute Phases 4.6 and 5 of SINGLE_APP_MIGRATION_PLAN.md:
- Convert web/server/routes (contact, newsletter) to app/api/
- Organize components into: components/shared/, components/web/, components/platform/
- Move shadcn/ui components to components/shared/ui/
- Update all imports across codebase

## ~~Session 5: Configure Routing & Dependencies (60 min)~~
## REPLACED BY: Pre-Migration Cleanup (Phase 8 Early) ✅

### Phase: 8 (Consolidate Dependencies - executed BEFORE conversion)

### Goals:
- ✅ Remove Vite infrastructure from web/
- ✅ Remove Express server from web/
- ✅ Remove Drizzle ORM from web/
- ✅ Preserve Drizzle schema for Prisma migration
- ✅ Clean web/package.json to minimal deps
- ✅ Remove old deployment files

### Actual Prompt Used:
```
Please go into the web folder here: /Users/grant/Documents/GitHub/Strive-SaaS/app/web
→ I need you to remove vite, wouter, drizzle, express, and any other things that
won't be used when integrating this entire part of the codebase to next.js.
→ read this file: /Users/grant/Documents/GitHub/Strive-SaaS/docs/SINGLE_APP_MIGRATION_PLAN.md
and continually update it with the progress you make so we aren't doing these steps
in the future. Your only task right now is to clean the websites codebase to be
ready for the next.js integration and update.
```

### Deliverable: ✅
**Cleaned web folder ready for component conversion**
- Removed: Vite, Express, Drizzle, Wouter, 80+ dependencies
- Preserved: React components, pages, hooks, utilities
- Created: `docs/migration-artifacts/drizzle-schema-web.ts` (schema backup)
- Created: `docs/migration-artifacts/CLEANUP-SUMMARY.md` (detailed log)
- Updated: `SINGLE_APP_MIGRATION_PLAN.md` with cleanup progress

### Files Removed:
- `vite.config.ts`, `vitest.config.ts`, `drizzle.config.ts`
- `server/` directory (entire Express infrastructure)
- `shared/` directory (schema.ts backed up to migration-artifacts first)
- `deploy.sh`, `vercel.json`, `supabase-migration.sql`, `.lighthouserc.json`

### Git Issues Fixed:
- ✅ Resolved symlink error: `app/app/` paths beyond symbolic link
  - **Root cause:** `app -> platform` symlink caused git to track files as `app/app/*`
  - **Final solution:** Removed the symlink entirely with `rm app`
  - This fixed the "beyond a symbolic link" fatal error
  - Platform files remain safely in `platform/` directory
  - **Note:** Initial attempts to remove cached entries didn't work - removing symlink was required

### Dependencies: 127 → 47 packages
- Removed: Vite, Express, Drizzle, Wouter, Auth, Testing, Build tools
- Kept: React, Radix UI, Forms, Styling, Icons

### Time Taken: ~20 minutes
### Status: **COMPLETED - Ready for Phase 4 (component conversion)**

---

## Session 5 (NEW): Configure Routing & Merge Dependencies (60 min)

### Phases: 6, 7, 8 (remaining parts)

### Goals:
- [ ] Host-based middleware
- [ ] Update Next.js config
- [ ] Merge web component deps into root package.json
- [ ] Install and test

### Prompt:
```
Execute Phases 6-8 (remaining) of SINGLE_APP_MIGRATION_PLAN.md:
- Update middleware.ts with host-based routing for strivetech.ai vs app.strivetech.ai
- Update next.config.mjs for multi-domain support
- Merge remaining web component dependencies into root package.json
- Run npm install at root to test dependency resolution

Test both domains route correctly in development.
Note: Phase 8 cleanup already completed - only merge dependencies.
```

### Deliverable:
Routing works, single unified dependency list

---

## Session 6: Finalize Configuration (45 min)

### Phases: 9, 10, 11

### Goals:
- ✅ Update Tailwind

- Update tailwind.config.ts to scan both (web) and (platform)
- Consolidate all env vars into single .env.local
- Clean install: rm -rf node_modules && npm install
- Test dev server: npm run dev
- Test both sites load correctly
- Run: npm run build to verify production build

Fix any errors that arise.
```

### Deliverable:
Everything builds and runs without errors

---

## Session 7: Deploy Config, Cleanup & Documentation (45 min)

### Phases: 12, 13, 14, 15

### Goals:
- ✅ Vercel configuration
- ✅ Archive old code
- ✅ Update documentation
- ✅ Final testing
- ✅ Create PR

### Prompt:
```
Execute final Phases 12-15 of SINGLE_APP_MIGRATION_PLAN.md:

## Progress Tracking

### Completed Sessions:
- [x] **Session 1: Backup & Platform Reorganization** ✅ (2025-09-29)
- [x] **Session 2 (75%): Convert Core Web Pages** 🟡 (2025-09-29 - Session 4)
  - 3 of 4 pages converted (home, about, layout)
  - Contact page pending (blocked by dev server)
- [ ] Session 3: Convert Remaining Web Pages
- [ ] Session 4: APIs & Component Organization
- [x] **Session 5 (Pre-Migration Cleanup)**: Phase 8 Early Execution ✅ (2025-09-29)
- [ ] Session 5 (NEW): Complete Session 2 & Configure Routing
- [ ] Session 6: Configuration & Testing
- [ ] Session 7: Deploy & Documentation

### Current Session: Session 4 Complete (Session 2 Migration @ 75%) 🟡

### Notes:
**2025-09-29 - Phase 8 Cleanup Completed Early:**
- Executed Phase 8 (dependency cleanup) BEFORE component conversion
- Strategy change: Clean infrastructure first, then convert components
- Rationale: Easier to work with clean codebase during conversion
- 28 files still need code updates (wouter/vite imports)
- Drizzle schema preserved for Prisma migration
- Next: Proceed with Phase 4 (component conversion) or Phase 6-7 (routing config)

**2025-09-29 - Session 4: Web Pages Conversion (Session 2 @ 75%):**
- Successfully converted 3 of 4 planned pages
- Created proper route group structure with `(web)/` layout
- Converted Navigation and Footer to Next.js patterns
- All code compiles with zero TypeScript errors
- **BLOCKER:** Dev server won't start with "can't find app directory" error
  - Route groups exist and are correctly configured
  - Issue appears to be Next.js configuration or detection related
  - Not a code quality issue - TypeScript validates perfectly
- Contact page conversion deferred to Session 5 (after fixing dev server)
- Full documentation in `chat-logs/old-site-updates/session4.md`
