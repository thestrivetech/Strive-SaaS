# Structure Refactoring Session Logs

**Purpose:** Track progress of refactoring the ENTIRE Strive SaaS platform to align with the industry-as-plugin architecture defined in [STRUCTURE-OVERVIEW-1.md](../../../docs/structure/STRUCTURE-OVERVIEW-1.md).

**📖 IMPORTANT:** This is a COMPREHENSIVE refactoring of `lib/`, `components/`, `app/` routes, database, and middleware. See [FULL-REFACTORING-SCOPE.md](./FULL-REFACTORING-SCOPE.md) for complete details.

## Target Architecture

Transform the ENTIRE `app/` directory from a flat structure to an industry-as-plugin architecture:

### lib/ Structure
```
lib/
├── modules/              # Core platform modules (no changes)
├── industries/           # 🚀 NEW: Industry implementations
│   ├── _core/           # Base abstractions
│   ├── healthcare/      # Healthcare industry
│   ├── real-estate/     # Real estate industry
│   └── registry.ts
└── tools/shared/        # Universal tools only
```

### components/ Structure
```
components/
├── ui/                  # shadcn (no changes)
├── shared/              # 🔄 RENAMED from "features"
├── industries/          # 🚀 NEW: Industry-specific UI
│   ├── healthcare/
│   ├── real-estate/
│   └── _shared/
└── web/                 # Legacy marketing (cleanup)
```

### app/ Routes Structure
```
app/
├── (chatbot)/          # No changes
├── (platform)/         # Protected routes
│   ├── dashboard/
│   ├── crm/
│   ├── projects/
│   ├── industries/     # 🚀 NEW: Dynamic industry routes
│   │   └── [industryId]/
│   └── settings/
│       └── industries/ # 🚀 NEW: Industry management
├── (web)/              # Legacy marketing
└── api/                # No changes
```

## Session Files

### SESSION-START-PROMPT.md
Template for starting each refactoring session. Copy this prompt to ensure you have full project context at the start of each session.

### session[N].md
Individual session logs tracking:
- Goals for the session
- What was accomplished
- What remains to be done
- Files changed
- Next steps
- Notes and observations

---

## How to Use

### Starting a New Session

1. Copy the session start prompt from `SESSION-START-PROMPT.md`
2. Replace `[SESSION_FOCUS]` with your specific goal
3. Paste into Claude Code
4. Work through the session
5. Update the session log with accomplishments

### Session Workflow

1. **Read** - Claude reads all reference files (CLAUDE.md, STRUCTURE-OVERVIEW-1.md, etc.)
2. **Audit** - Review current state with Glob/Grep
3. **Plan** - Create detailed task list using TodoWrite
4. **Implement** - Make changes following TDD approach
5. **Test** - Verify 80%+ coverage
6. **Document** - Update session log

### After Each Session

1. Fill in "What Was Accomplished" section
2. Update "What Remains" with outstanding tasks
3. List all "Files Changed"
4. Note next session focus
5. Add any important observations to "Notes"

| 6 | ⏸️ Pending | Implement first industry (healthcare) - components side | TBD |
| 7 | ⏸️ Pending | Add `app/(platform)/industries/[industryId]/` routes | TBD |
| 8 | ⏸️ Pending | Database schema updates (Industry enum, IndustryModule) | TBD |
| 9 | ⏸️ Pending | Update middleware for industry context | TBD |
| 10 | ⏸️ Pending | Migrate features to industry-specific implementations | TBD |
| 11+ | ⏸️ Pending | Additional industries, testing, documentation | TBD |

## Key Principles

1. **READ BEFORE EDIT** - Always use Read tool before modifying files
2. **SEARCH FIRST** - Use Glob/Grep to check if structures exist
3. **UPDATE, DON'T CREATE** - Prefer editing over creating new files
4. **TDD APPROACH** - Write tests first, then implementation
5. **80% COVERAGE** - Maintain minimum test coverage
6. **500 LINE LIMIT** - Hard limit enforced by ESLint
