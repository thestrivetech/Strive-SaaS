User: How can I keep from using the redundant app/app? I currently don't have that setup in the repo so why is it currently mentioned over and over? It's Strive-SaaS/app/ correct? Or what am I missing?

**UPDATE (2025-09-29): This document is outdated. The fix has been implemented and we ARE now using the app/app/ structure as required by Next.js App Router.**

The actual final structure is:

```
Strive-SaaS/
├── app/                  # Next.js project root
│   ├── app/              # App Router directory (REQUIRED by Next.js)
│   │   ├── page.tsx      # Root page (redirects to /platform/dashboard)
│   │   ├── layout.tsx    # Root layout
│   │   ├── globals.css
│   │   ├── (platform)/   # SaaS platform routes
│   │   ├── (web)/        # Marketing site routes
│   │   └── api/          # API routes
│   ├── components/
│   ├── lib/
│   ├── package.json
│   └── next.config.mjs
```

The `app/app/` structure is NOT redundant - it's required by Next.js 15 App Router. The first `app/` is the project root, the second `app/` is where Next.js looks for App Router files.

**ORIGINAL DISCUSSION (NOW OUTDATED):**

## Fix for Your Route Groups Issue

The error `Couldn't find any 'pages' or 'app' directory` occurs because Next.js expects either:
1. An `app/` folder (for App Router), OR
2. A `pages/` folder (for Pages Router)

But you have **route groups** `(platform)/` and `(web)/` instead of a direct `app/` folder.

### Solution: Create a Root Page

Since you're using route groups, you need to either:

**Option 1: Add a root page.tsx**
```typescript
// app/page.tsx (at the same level as your route groups)
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation'

export default function RootPage() {
  // Redirect to platform or marketing based on your logic
  redirect('/dashboard') // or redirect('/') for marketing
}
```

**Option 2: Move route groups to a proper app structure**
Your current structure should work, but if it doesn't, you can create:
```
app/
├── app/              # Create this folder
│   ├── (platform)/   # Move your platform routes here
│   ├── (web)/        # Move your web routes here  
│   └── page.tsx      # Root page
```

**Option 3: Set up proper Next.js config**
Make sure your `next.config.js` doesn't have any conflicting settings:

```javascript
// app/next.config.mjs
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  // Remove any custom page directory configs
}

export default nextConfig
```

The cleanest approach is **Option 1** - just add a `page.tsx` file at `app/page.tsx` that handles your root route logic. This maintains your clean structure while satisfying Next.js requirements.


# New instructions for Option 1 fix.

Ensure you have exactly one root-level App Router file at app/page.tsx (not under any subfolder). The contents should be:

tsx
// app/page.tsx
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation'

export default function Page() {
  // Always redirect to your chosen default route:
  return redirect('/platform/dashboard')
}
Key points:

Location: app/page.tsx (not app/app/page.tsx or under (platform) or (web)).

Export: export default function Page() with a direct return redirect(...).

Redirect target: Use a valid route group entrypoint (e.g. /platform/dashboard or /web).

After creating this file:

Delete the .next folder.

Restart with npm run dev from the app/ directory (where next.config.js sits).

Visit http://localhost:3000 → it should immediately redirect to /platform/dashboard.

This satisfies Next.js’s requirement for a root App Router page and resolves the “no app directory” error.
