User: How can I keep from using the redundant app/app? I currently don't have that setup in the repo so why is it currently mentioned over and over? It's Strive-SaaS/app/ correct? Or what am I missing?

You're absolutely right! I apologize for the confusion. Looking at the actual repository structure, you have:[1]

```
Strive-SaaS/
├── app/
│   ├── (platform)/     # Next.js SaaS platform routes
│   ├── (web)/          # Marketing site routes  
│   ├── web/            # Legacy marketing site folder
│   ├── components/
│   ├── lib/
│   ├── prisma/
│   └── package.json    # Next.js project config
```

You're **NOT** using the redundant `app/app/` structure that I kept mentioning. Your structure is much cleaner:

- **`app/`** is the Next.js project root[1]
- **`(platform)/`** contains your SaaS routes (login, dashboard, crm, etc.)[1]
- **`(web)/`** contains marketing routes[1]
- **`web/`** contains the legacy React marketing site[1]

## Fix for Your Route Groups Issue

The error `Couldn't find any 'pages' or 'app' directory` occurs because Next.js expects either:
1. An `app/` folder (for App Router), OR
2. A `pages/` folder (for Pages Router)

But you have **route groups** `(platform)/` and `(web)/` instead of a direct `app/` folder.

### Solution: Create a Root Page

Since you're using route groups, you need to either:

**Option 1: Add a root page.tsx**
```typescript
// app/page.tsx (at the same level as your route groups)
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation'

export default function RootPage() {
  // Redirect to platform or marketing based on your logic
  redirect('/dashboard') // or redirect('/') for marketing
}
```

**Option 2: Move route groups to a proper app structure**
Your current structure should work, but if it doesn't, you can create:
```
app/
├── app/              # Create this folder
│   ├── (platform)/   # Move your platform routes here
│   ├── (web)/        # Move your web routes here  
│   └── page.tsx      # Root page
```

**Option 3: Set up proper Next.js config**
Make sure your `next.config.js` doesn't have any conflicting settings:

```javascript
// app/next.config.mjs
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  // Remove any custom page directory configs
}

export default nextConfig
```

The cleanest approach is **Option 1** - just add a `page.tsx` file at `app/page.tsx` that handles your root route logic. This maintains your clean structure while satisfying Next.js requirements.
