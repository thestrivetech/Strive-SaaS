Please read the following files in this order to understand
  the project context and session goals:

  1. Project Documentation:
     - /Users/grant/Documents/GitHub/Strive-SaaS/CLAUDE.md
     - /Users/grant/Documents/GitHub/Strive-SaaS/README.md

  2. Current Session Plan:
     - /Users/grant/Documents/GitHub/Strive-SaaS/chat-logs/NEW
  -REVIEW-&-UPDATE/session-logs/Session5.md

  3. Previous Session Summary (for context):
     - /Users/grant/Documents/GitHub/Strive-SaaS/chat-logs/NEW
  -REVIEW-&-UPDATE/session-logs/Session4-Summary.md

  After reading all files, create a comprehensive todo list
  that covers all tasks from the current session plan
  (Session5.md). Make sure the todo list:
  - Follows the phase order from the session plan
  - Includes all specific tasks with clear action items
  - Marks phases as pending with one item as in_progress when 
  ready to start
  - Includes verification steps after major phases
  - Uses descriptive task names that match the session plan

  Once the todo list is created, I'm ready to start executing 
  Session 5.

  that covers all tasks from the current session plan
  (Session[N].md). Make sure the todo list:
  - Follows the phase order from the session plan
  - Includes all specific tasks with clear action items
  - Marks phases as pending with one item as in_progress when 
  ready to start
  - Includes verification steps after major phases
  - Uses descriptive task names that match the session plan

  Once the todo list is created, lets start executing 
  Session [6].
