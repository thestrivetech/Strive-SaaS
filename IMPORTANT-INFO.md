# Token Usage & Context Window #

How many tokens does it take to read 4 files? Mainly The session chat log, and these three files: 
/Users/grant/Documents/GitHub/Strive-SaaS/CLAUDE.md - /Users/grant/Documents/GitHub/Strive-SaaS/docs/README.md & 
/Users/grant/Documents/GitHub/Strive-SaaS/docs/APP_BUILD_PLAN.md

⏺ Token Count Analysis

  Based on reading all 4 files:

  | File                   | Approximate Tokens |
  |------------------------|--------------------|
  | CLAUDE.md              | ~1,800 tokens      |
  | docs/README.md         | ~4,200 tokens      |
  | docs/APP_BUILD_PLAN.md | ~2,800 tokens      |
  | chat-logs/Session5.md  | ~3,100 tokens      |
  | Total                  | ~11,900 tokens     |

  Context Window Impact

  For a typical session start:
  - Reading these 4 files: ~11,900 tokens
  - Your system prompt + instructions: ~10,000 tokens
  - User conversation: ~5,000 tokens
  - Total baseline: ~26,900 tokens

  With 200K context window:
  - These files use ~6% of available context
  - Leaves 173K tokens for actual development work
  - Very efficient and sustainable

  Optimization Observations

  The current setup is already quite efficient:

  1. CLAUDE.md (1,800 tokens) - Concise, focuses on critical rules
  2. Session5.md (3,100 tokens) - Focused task list, not bloated
  3. APP_BUILD_PLAN.md (2,800 tokens) - Project overview only
  4. docs/README.md (4,200 tokens) - Most verbose but comprehensive

  Recommendation

  The current structure is good. ~12K tokens for full context is reasonable. However, if you want to optimize further:

  Option 1: Create Session Start Checklist (reduce to ~8K tokens)
  - Ultra-compact checklist that references full docs
  - Read full docs only when needed for specific tasks

  Option 2: Keep as-is (current ~12K tokens)
  - Already efficient at 6% of context window
  - Comprehensive context prevents mistakes
  - Worth the token cost for quality

  My suggestion: Keep current approach. 12K tokens for complete context is a worthwhile investment that prevents errors and ensures consistency.

# Deployment Types # - Might not be applicable

Scripts let you run each app individually (npm run dev:app) or both in parallel (npm run dev).

In app/web and app/app, keep each folder’s own next.config.js, package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.—they remain completely isolated from each other. Next.js will only look for app/ or pages/ inside the folder you cd into.

If you’re using Vercel, you can set up two separate project deployments:

One targeting the app/web folder (production domain strivetech.ai)

One targeting the app/app folder (subdomain app.strivetech.ai)
Vercel will detect each Next.js project by its package.json and build settings.

Shared code (e.g. design tokens, React components, utilities) can live in a top-level packages/ui or shared/ folder and be imported by both apps with workspace path aliases. Example:

text
// tsconfig.json (monorepo root)
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@shared/*": ["shared/*"]
    }
  }
}
Benefits of this structure:

Each app has isolation—no confusing root-level next.js lookups.

Clear separation of concerns: marketing site vs. SaaS platform.

Shared components/utilities can be hoisted into a workspace package.

You continue to adhere to Next.js expectations (each project has its own app/ or pages/ folder).

With this setup, you never need to move files or rename folders, and your two domains remain fully decoupled yet part of a single monorepo.
