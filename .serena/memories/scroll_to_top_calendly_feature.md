# Scroll-to-Top Calendly Feature Implementation

## Feature Added
Implemented smooth scroll-to-top functionality that automatically scrolls users to the top of the page when they reach the Calendly scheduling step. This ensures users immediately see the calendar widget instead of being stuck at the bottom of the form.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Request Page (request.tsx)
**Location**: "Next" button onClick handler around line 804
**Trigger**: When user moves from step 2 to step 3 (the Calendly step)

```typescript
onClick={() => {
  const nextStep = formStep + 1;
  setFormStep(nextStep);
  // Scroll to top when reaching the Calendly step (step 3)
  if (nextStep === 3) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      window.scrollTo({ top: 0, left: 0, behavior: 'smooth' });
    }, 100);
  }
}}
```

### 2. Assessment Page (assessment.tsx)  
**Location**: `handleSubmitContact` function around line 231
**Trigger**: When user completes step 1 and moves to step 2 (the Calendly step)

```typescript
if (response.ok && result.success) {
  console.log("Assessment request submitted successfully:", result);
  setIsSubmitted(true);
  setStep(2);
  // Scroll to top when reaching the Calendly step (step 2)
  setTimeout(() => {
    window.scrollTo({ top: 0, left: 0, behavior: 'smooth' });
  }, 100);
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### Scroll Behavior
- **Method**: `window.scrollTo({ top: 0, left: 0, behavior: 'smooth' })`
- **Timing**: 100ms delay using `setTimeout()` to ensure DOM updates complete first
- **Animation**: Smooth scroll animation for professional user experience

### User Experience Flow
1. **Request Page**: User fills out steps 1-2 → clicks "Next" → automatically scrolls to top to see Calendly widget in step 3
2. **Assessment Page**: User fills out step 1 → clicks "Proceed to Scheduling" → automatically scrolls to top to see Calendly widget in step 2

## Why This Matters
- **Better UX**: Users immediately see the calendar widget instead of being confused at the bottom of the page
- **Higher Conversion**: No friction between form completion and scheduling
- **Professional Feel**: Smooth, guided experience that feels polished
- **Mobile Friendly**: Especially important on mobile devices where scrolling can be cumbersome

## Testing Status
✅ TypeScript compilation successful  
✅ Production build successful (2.67s)  
✅ No build errors or warnings  
✅ Smooth scroll behavior implemented on both pages

## Result
Users now have a seamless transition from form completion to scheduling, with automatic smooth scrolling ensuring the Calendly widget is immediately visible and accessible.
