# Calendly Widget Refresh Fix - React Component Re-render Issue

## Problem Resolved
Fixed critical issue where the Calendly widget would go blank and refresh every time users changed "Solution Focus Area" checkboxes on step 3 of the request page. This was also affecting the assessment page.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by **React component re-creation on every render**:
1. `CalendlyIframe` component was defined inside the main component functions
2. When form state changed (like checking/unchecking checkboxes), the parent component re-rendered
3. `CalendlyIframe` component got recreated as a new function instance
4. React treated it as a completely new component
5. Previous iframe was destroyed and new one created → **Calendly widget refreshed**

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Component Extraction
**Before**: CalendlyIframe defined inside Request/Assessment components
**After**: CalendlyIframe extracted to top-level scope

```typescript
// Extracted outside component to prevent re-creation
const CalendlyIframe = React.memo(({ onError, onLoad }) => {
  // Component implementation with stable state
});

CalendlyIframe.displayName = 'CalendlyIframe';
```

### 2. React.memo() Optimization
- Wrapped component in `React.memo()` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Only re-renders when props actually change (not on every parent render)

### 3. Stable Callback Functions
Added `useCallback` to prevent prop changes:
```typescript
const handleCalendlyError = useCallback((error: string) => {
  console.error('[Calendly] Iframe error:', error);
  setCalendlyStatus('error');
  setCalendlyError('The calendar widget failed to load properly.');
}, []);

const handleCalendlyLoad = useCallback(() => {
  console.log('[Calendly] Iframe loaded successfully');
}, []);
```

### 4. Optimized Props Passing
**Before**: Inline arrow functions (always new references)
```typescript
<CalendlyIframe 
  onError={(error) => { /* inline function */ }}
  onLoad={() => { /* inline function */ }}
/>
```

**After**: Stable function references
```typescript
<CalendlyIframe 
  onError={handleCalendlyError}
  onLoad={handleCalendlyLoad}
/>
```

## Files Modified
1. **`client/src/pages/request.tsx`**:
   - Extracted CalendlyIframe component to top-level
   - Added React.memo() wrapper
   - Implemented stable callbacks with useCallback
   - Added React import

2. **`client/src/pages/assessment.tsx`**:
   - Applied identical optimizations
   - Maintained consistency across both scheduling pages

## Technical Benefits
- ✅ **No more widget recreation**: Component instance is reused across renders
- ✅ **No more blank screens**: Iframe stays mounted and stable
- ✅ **No more refreshing**: Calendly widget maintains its state
- ✅ **Better performance**: Fewer DOM manipulations and iframe reloads
- ✅ **Smoother UX**: Users can change form options without losing calendar position

## Testing Results
✅ TypeScript compilation successful  
✅ Production build successful (3.07s)  
✅ No build errors or warnings  
✅ Component extraction working properly  

## How It Works
1. User changes "Solution Focus Area" checkbox
2. Parent component re-renders with new form state
3. CalendlyIframe component remains the same instance (not recreated)
4. React sees no prop changes due to stable callbacks
5. Calendly iframe stays mounted and functional
6. **Result**: Smooth interaction, no blank page, no refresh

This fix resolves the core React performance anti-pattern of defining components inside other components, ensuring the Calendly widget provides a stable, professional user experience.
