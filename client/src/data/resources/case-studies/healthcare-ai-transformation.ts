  shortDescription: "Regional Medical Center achieved 45% faster diagnostics and 30% cost reduction with AI implementation.",
  fullDescription: "This detailed case study examines how Regional Medical Center Network, spanning 12 hospitals with 3,500+ staff, revolutionized patient care through AI-powered healthcare solutions. Over 18 months, they deployed computer vision for medical imaging analysis, predictive analytics for patient risk assessment, and NLP for clinical documentation. The implementation resulted in 45% reduction in diagnostic time, 30% decrease in operational costs, 92% patient satisfaction score, and 60% reduction in readmission rates. Learn about their phased approach, staff training programs, and the critical success factors that made this transformation possible.",
