  title: "Multi-Agent Systems",
  shortDescription: "Coordinated AI agent architecture for complex problem-solving and workflow automation.",
  fullDescription: "Multi-agent systems represent the next evolution in AI architecture, where specialized agents work together to solve complex problems that single agents cannot handle effectively. This guide covers agent design patterns, communication protocols, coordination strategies, and implementation frameworks. Learn to build systems where agents collaborate, compete, and coordinate to achieve sophisticated objectives in domains like automated trading, smart cities, and distributed problem-solving.",
