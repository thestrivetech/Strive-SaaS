I've made some recent changes to the workflow for the website development process. I made the specific change of making the main Claude Code chat the "Orchestrator" rather than creating a subagent for this role. Overall it makes more sense and will help the workflow process tremendously since in this way, I can directly communicate with the "Orchestrator". So now I need your help with changing and updating the documentation with this change. Additionally I removed the "Evaluator" subagent and I'm giving it's responsibilities to the "Orchestrator." I've already made small notes of this within the files which are attached in the GitHub repo (in project knowledge).

Here's more specific details on what I need you to do:

I need help updating my project documentation to reflect a new workflow architecture. I'm transitioning from using a separate "orchestrator subagent" to using the main Claude Code session as the natural orchestrator for my development workflows.

## Context & Goal

I previously had an architecture where:

- Main Claude Code â†’ Orchestrator Subagent â†’ Worker Subagents

I'm now switching to:

- Main Claude Code Session (as orchestrator) â†’ Specialized Subagents

## What I Need You To Do

Please review all my markdown documentation files and update them to reflect this new workflow. Specifically:

### 1. Find and Replace References

Look for any mentions of:

- "orchestrator subagent"

- "orchestrator agent" 

- "project manager subagent"

- "main orchestrator"

- Similar orchestration-related subagent references

Replace these with:

- "main Claude Code session"

- "Claude Code orchestrator"

- "main Claude session"

- Or similar phrasing that indicates the main Claude Code chat is the "main orchestrator."

### 2. Update Workflow Descriptions to reflect this change

### 3. Specific Changes to Make

Before (examples to look for):

- "The orchestrator subagent will coordinate between..."

- "First, the orchestrator analyzes the task..."

- "The main orchestrator delegates to..."

- "Configure the orchestrator subagent with..."

After (what to change to):

- "The main Claude Code session will coordinate between..."

- "First, Claude Code analyzes the task and delegates to..."

- "The main session delegates to..."

- "Use the main Claude Code session to..."

### 4. Update Command Examples

Change command examples if there are any

### 5. Configuration References

Remove any references to:

- Orchestrator subagent configuration files

- Setting up the orchestrator subagent

- Orchestrator-specific tools or permissions

Replace with guidance about:

- Using natural language to direct the main session

- How Claude Code automatically coordinates workflows

- Multi-step prompting techniques

### 6. Preserve Existing Content

- Keep all existing subagent configurations for worker subagents (backend-developer, test-writer, etc.)

- Maintain all workflow steps and logic

- Preserve any domain-specific context or requirements

- Keep all tool configurations and MCP server setups

### 7. Update Any Diagrams or Visual Representations

If there are ASCII diagrams, flowcharts, or visual representations showing the old architecture, update them to remove the orchestrator subagent layer.

## Instructions for Review

1. Go through each .md file systematically

2. Look for the patterns I've described above

3. Make the necessary updates while preserving the intent and structure

4. Ensure consistency in terminology across all files

5. If you're unsure about a specific change, flag it for my review

## Files to Focus On

Pay special attention to:

- README files

- Workflow documentation

- Setup/configuration guides  

- Architecture documentation

- Any "getting started" or onboarding docs

Please start by showing me which files you found that need updates, then proceed with the actual edits. For each file, briefly explain what changes you're making so I can verify they align with the new architecture.

### 6. Change and give all evaluator duties and responsibilities to the main orchestrator

### Additionally make note of the changes made to the chat log folder layout and make sure all documentation for agents is updated with how to use this updated documentation system.

- Another task after everything above has been completed: Delete the evaluator agent once all responsibilities and dutis have been assigned to the Main Orchestrator 

- Assign the Playwright MCP tool to the Frontend Agent & the UI agent. This will be essential for them to be able to see the actual design of the website currently and after they make any changes

- Make sure the main orchestrator (you, claude) is using Serena MCP for quicker and smarter searches when needed.

- Change development docs to this specific project (I imported them from a different project so the details and content found within them are for another project instead of this one) the docs are located here: C:\Users\zochr\Desktop\GitHub\Strive_Website_Replit\docs\development - This will serve as a guide to you and all agents when it comes to rules and context for what we want to achieve within this project.

- Make sure the dev_rules file here: C:\Users\zochr\Desktop\GitHub\Strive_Website_Replit\docs\development\dev_rules.md is specifically updated so that it's specific to this project but I still want to emphasize the rule of not creating monolithic code files. We need to follow the existing codebase pattern which can be found and specified by using the files found in the project (can look at files found within this folder: C:\Users\zochr\Desktop\GitHub\Strive_Website_Replit\client\src or C:\Users\zochr\Desktop\GitHub\Strive_Website_Replit\server or C:\Users\zochr\Desktop\GitHub\Strive_Website_Replit\shared)
