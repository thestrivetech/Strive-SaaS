# Perplexity Recommendation #

Exact response: 

A strong typography hierarchy for a tech company's AI solutions website should use clear levels—headline, subhead, and body text—leveraging size, weight, and color to guide users through the most important content.

- Core Hierarchy Levels
Headlines (H1): Use large, bold, modern sans-serif fonts for clarity and innovation. Typical web font sizes range 36–48px for hero titles.

Subheadings (H2, H3): Slightly smaller, medium-weight sans-serif fonts (24–30px for H2, 18–21px for H3), using a distinct color or lighter weight for separation.

Body Text: Balanced, highly-readable sans-serif or humanist serif fonts (16–18px), regular weight, dark grey or black for maximum legibility.

- Additional Considerations
Meta Information/Captions: 10–12px, light gray, lower contrast for less critical details.

Font Pairing: Use one or two typefaces—combine a tech-forward sans-serif (e.g., Evolve Sans, Roboto, Inter) for headings with a contrasting body font.

Consistency: Maintain consistent spacing, capitalization, and alignment at each level for a clean tech aesthetic.

- Best Practices
Contrast: Size and weight differences must be clear—don’t rely solely on minimal pixel changes.

Alignment/Position: Center or left-align headlines for prominence. Use spacing above/below headings to visually separate sections.

Color Usage: Restrained accent colors can highlight calls-to-action or subheads but maintain strong readability.

Example Hierarchy
Level	Font Example	Size (px)	Weight	Color	Usage
Headline (H1)	Inter Bold	40	Bold	#212121	Main page title
Subhead (H2)	Inter SemiBold	28	SemiBold	#545454/#007AFF	Section title
Subhead (H3)	Inter Medium	20	Medium	#545454	Subsection title
Body	Inter Regular	16	Regular	#212121	Paragraph text
Caption/Meta	Inter Light	12	Light	#888888	Author, date

This hierarchy ensures important information stands out while supporting brand clarity, technical credibility, and user accessibility.

# Grok Recommendation #

Grok response:

For an AI solutions company website, your typography hierarchy should prioritize clarity, modernity, and readability to convey innovation and trustworthiness. Tech sites like yours benefit from clean sans-serif fonts (e.g., Inter, Roboto, or Helvetica) that feel futuristic without being distracting. Limit to 1-2 font families for consistency, and use a modular scale for sizes to ensure harmony—starting with body text at 16px as a base.

Here's a recommended hierarchy, drawing from best practices. I've tailored it for a tech/AI context: larger headings for impactful section titles (e.g., "Our AI Platforms"), subtle weights for scannability, and ample spacing for dense technical content. This uses a 1.25 scale factor for progression, which is common for digital designs.

Element | Font Family | Size (desktop) | Weight | Line Height | Style Notes
- H1 (Page Title) | "Sans-serif (e.g., Inter)" | 48px,Bold (700) | 1.2 | Uppercase for emphasis; use sparingly for hero sections or landing page titles.
- H2 (Section Heading) | "Sans-serif (e.g., Inter)" | 32px,Bold (700) | 1.3 | "Title case; ideal for features like ""Machine Learning Solutions."""
- H3 (Subheading) | "Sans-serif (e.g., Inter)" | 24px,Semi-bold (600) | 1.4 | "Sentence case; for subsections like ""Key Benefits."""
- H4 (Minor Subheading) | "Sans-serif (e.g., Inter)" | 20px,Medium (500) | 1.4 | For details like bullet intros or cards.
- Body Text | "Sans-serif (e.g., Inter)" | 16px,Regular (400) | 1.6 | "High readability; adjust to 18px if content is data-heavy. Pair with a secondary serif (e.g., Georgia) for quotes if needed for contrast."
- Caption/Label | "Sans-serif (e.g., Inter)" | 14px,Regular (400)| 1.5 | "Italic or lighter gray for image captions, metadata, or form labels."
- Button/Link | "Sans-serif (e.g., Inter)"| 16px,Medium (500) | 1.4 | "Uppercase or bold for CTAs like ""Get Started""; ensure high contrast (e.g., WCAG-compliant)."

Why This Hierarchy?

Levels and Scale: Start with 3-4 core levels (H1-H3 plus body) to avoid clutter, then add as needed for elements like nav or footers. This follows a classic typographic scale for logical flow, guiding users from broad overviews to details.

Font Choices: Sans-serif aligns with tech branding for a clean, professional vibe—grotesque styles work well for data-intensive AI content.
Avoid serifs for main text unless it's long-form reading.

Readability Tweaks: Use 1.5-2x line spacing and limit line lengths to 50-75 characters for better comprehension on tech topics. Ensure responsive adjustments: scale down sizes by 20-30% on mobile.

Styling: Differentiate with weight and color over size alone (e.g., bold for emphasis, subtle italics for asides). Stick to 2-3 fonts total to maintain load speed and cohesion.

# Grok Response: 

For your AI solutions company website, the best font should balance modernity, readability, and a tech-forward aesthetic. Based on current web design trends and the needs of a tech-focused site, Inter is the top recommendation for this use case. Here’s why and how to implement it, along with guidance on a font package:
Why Inter?

Clarity and Readability: Inter is a sans-serif font designed for digital interfaces, with high legibility at small sizes (e.g., body text at 16px) and clear distinctions between similar characters (like "I" and "l"), which is critical for technical content like code snippets or data tables.
Tech Aesthetic: Its geometric, clean design aligns perfectly with AI and tech branding, conveying precision and innovation without feeling sterile. It’s used by companies like GitHub and Figma for similar reasons.
Versatility: Inter offers a wide range of weights (100-900), allowing for a robust typography hierarchy (e.g., bold H1s at 48px, regular body at 16px) without needing multiple fonts. It supports both display and body text effectively.
Open Source and Free: Available under the SIL Open Font License, it’s cost-effective and widely accessible, with no licensing issues for commercial use.
Web Performance: Inter is optimized for web use, with variable font options that reduce file size and improve load times, crucial for SEO and user experience on tech sites.

Alternatives to Consider
If Inter doesn’t suit your brand or you want options:

Roboto: Google’s flagship font, widely used in tech (e.g., Android). It’s slightly softer than Inter but equally versatile, with excellent multilingual support. Great if you want a familiar, polished look.
Poppins: A geometric sans-serif with a slightly friendlier vibe, ideal if your AI brand leans toward approachability. It’s less technical but still modern.
Montserrat: Bolder and more stylish, good for headings if you want a stronger visual impact. Pair with Inter or Roboto for body text to maintain readability.
Source Sans Pro: Adobe’s open-source sans-serif, designed for UI. It’s a solid fallback with a professional yet slightly warmer feel than Inter.

Recommended Font Package
Instead of relying on a single font, a font pairing ensures visual interest while maintaining cohesion. For your AI solutions site, use this package:

Primary Font: Inter (for body, headings, and UI elements like buttons). Use weights 400 (regular) for body, 500-600 for subheadings, and 700-800 for headings.
Secondary Font (Optional): If you need contrast for quotes, testimonials, or decorative elements, pair Inter with a serif like Lora or Merriweather. These add warmth for narrative sections without clashing with the tech vibe. Use sparingly (e.g., 18px italic for quotes).
Fallbacks: Specify system font fallbacks for performance: font-family: Inter, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, sans-serif;. This ensures compatibility if Inter fails to load.


# Additional Key Notes #

CSS Setup: Host the font files on your server or use a CDN like Google Fonts. 

- Example:
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;600;700&display=swap');
body {
  font-family: Inter, sans-serif;
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1.6;
}
h1 {
  font-size: 48px;
  font-weight: 700;
  line-height: 1.2;
}
