Session to session continuation: 

Please stop what you're doing and document everything from this session in the chat log: C:\Users\zochr\Desktop\GitHub\Strive_Website_Replit\chat_logs\orchestrator\session1.md in great detail along with remaining tasks that you did not complete. Also mention everything that you just found while double checking your work in great detail here: C:\Users\zochr\Desktop\GitHub\Strive_Website_Replit\agent_update_prompt.md - Please be very clear in communication so that when I start the new session I can pass along complete context from this session into the next session by using these files. Provide the complete to-do list in this file as well so we can pick up from where we left off moving into the new session.

Mid-session prompt: 

Please double check all work that has been done thus far. Make sure it is up to the standard of perfection or at the very least, a perfect effort. After all work quality has been double checked, please document everything in this session up to this point in this sessions chat log. It should be ready for hand-off at any given moment in case the context window reaches full capacity. Be very detailed in all documentation to provide the best context for this session going into next session. Make sure all to-do lists are up to par and that all "completed" tasks are actually completed. Make sure that all remaining tasks on the to-do list are detailed enough to continue into next session if needed. This standard should be kept in every single session that we have with no exceptions. You're doing great Claude, keep it up.

Ok sweet, now please update this sessions chat log in complete and full detail of everything from this session to provide complete context for next session. Also mention at the end that we still need to improve the memory.json "brain" file to be a fully functional brain (reference what I said in my last response about the specific file paths). This agent workflow markdown file will be essential to the the Main Orchestrator (you, Claude) to read at the start of every session so it should be mentioned with the other essential files for it to read.

Haven't used yet Session start for pdp & pdp file implementation: 

| Please read all necessary documentation for session start given the provided context: This sessions │ │ goal is to update each project development plan for each agent along with the main one which is here: │ │ C:\Users\zochr\Desktop\GitHub\Strive_Website_Replit\chat_logs\pdp.md - All of the individual ones │ │ for the agents are inside of their own chat logs which are found in the same folder. We need to make │ │ sure that the two main plan.md files: │ │ C:\Users\zochr\Desktop\GitHub\Strive_Website_Replit\updates\plan.md & │ │ C:\Users\zochr\Desktop\GitHub\Strive_Website_Replit\plan.md are combined into one massive │ │ guide/overview file which is here: │ │ C:\Users\zochr\Desktop\GitHub\Strive_Website_Replit\chat_logs\pdp.md - After doing this we need to │ │ split all phases, tasks, and implementations to each respected agents pdg.md file which will be in │ │ charge of doing the work and assigned by the orchestrator. This has to be done very strategically and │ │ thought out to the greatest degree... This is the most critical part of the agentic system and │ │ workflow... Please document everything in full complete detail so we can improve it if needed. Create │ │ this sessions chat log using the chat log template and create a very detailed and extensive to-do │ │ list that you keep track of in the session chat log. Please don't do partial reads on files in this │ │ session since this session is so critical to the development of our project. |
