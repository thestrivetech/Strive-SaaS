Session to session continuation: 
Please stop what you're doing and document everything from this session in the chat log: C:\Users\zochr\Desktop\GitHub\Strive_Website_Replit\chat_logs\orchestrator\session1.md  in great detail along with remaining tasks that you did not complete. Also mention everything that you just found while double checking your work in great detail here: C:\Users\zochr\Desktop\GitHub\Strive_Website_Replit\agent_update_prompt.md - Please be very clear in communication so that when I start the new session I can pass along complete context from this session into the next session by using these files. Provide the complete to-do list in this file as well so we can pick up from where we left off moving into the new session.

Mid-session prompt:
Please double check all work that has been done thus far. Make sure it is up to the standard of perfection or at the very least, a perfect effort. After all work quality has been double checked, please document everything in this session up to this point in this sessions chat log. It should be ready for hand-off at any given moment in case the context window reaches full capacity. Be very detailed in all documentation to provide the best context for this session going into next session. Make sure all to-do lists are up to par and that all "completed" tasks are actually completed. Make sure that all remaining tasks on the to-do list are detailed enough to continue into next session if needed. This standard should be kept in every single session that we have with no exceptions. You're doing great Claude, keep it up.
