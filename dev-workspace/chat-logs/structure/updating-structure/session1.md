**Date:** 2025-10-03
**Duration:** TBD
**Status:** =ï¿½ Ready to Start

## Session Start Prompt

I'm starting a new session to refactor the Strive SaaS platform to align with the industry-as-plugin architecture.

Please read the following files to understand the project context and development standards:

1. **Development Standards & Rules:**
   - /Users/grant/Documents/GitHub/Strive-SaaS/CLAUDE.md

2. **Architecture Documentation:**
   - /Users/grant/Documents/GitHub/Strive-SaaS/docs/structure/STRUCTURE-OVERVIEW-1.md (PRIMARY - industry-as-plugin architecture)
   - /Users/grant/Documents/GitHub/Strive-SaaS/docs/structure/MULTI-INDUSTRY-ARCHITECTURE.md (future evolution)
   - /Users/grant/Documents/GitHub/Strive-SaaS/docs/structure/TYPES-GUIDE.md (type system)
   - /Users/grant/Documents/GitHub/Strive-SaaS/docs/structure/tools-guide.md (tool organization)

3. **Current State:**
   - /Users/grant/Documents/GitHub/Strive-SaaS/README.md (project overview)
   - /Users/grant/Documents/GitHub/Strive-SaaS/project-directory-map.txt (current directory structure - first 500 lines)

After reading these files, please:

1. Confirm you understand the target architecture:
   - Core modules in `lib/modules/` (CRM, Projects, AI, Tasks)
   - Industry implementations in `lib/industries/[industry]/` (features, tools, overrides)
   - Shared tools in `lib/tools/shared/` (universal marketplace tools)

2. Review the current state of the codebase to identify what needs to be refactored

3. Present a concise plan for today's session focusing on the initial structure creation

**Session Focus:**
Conduct a COMPREHENSIVE audit of the entire `app/` directory (not just `lib/`) to understand the full scope of the refactoring. This includes `lib/`, `components/`, `app/` routes, database schema, and middleware. The refactoring applies the industry-as-plugin architecture to ALL parts of the application.

**ðŸ“– Full Scope:** See [FULL-REFACTORING-SCOPE.md](./FULL-REFACTORING-SCOPE.md) for complete details of what needs to be refactored.

**Critical Reminders:**
- Always READ files before editing them
- Use Glob/Grep to check if files/structures already exist before creating
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Follow the 500-line file size limit (hard limit enforced by ESLint)
- Write tests FIRST (TDD approach)
- Maintain 80%+ test coverage

## Goals for Session 1

**IMPORTANT:** This is a COMPREHENSIVE refactoring of the entire `app/` directory, not just `lib/`. See [FULL-REFACTORING-SCOPE.md](./FULL-REFACTORING-SCOPE.md) for complete details.

### Audit Phase (Complete Current State Assessment)
- [ ] Audit `lib/` directory structure
  - [ ] List all modules in `lib/modules/`
  - [ ] List all tools in `lib/tools/`
  - [ ] Check if `lib/industries/` already exists
  - [ ] Check if `lib/types/` has industry-specific types

- [ ] Audit `components/` directory structure
  - [ ] Identify what's in `components/features/`
  - [ ] Identify legacy marketing components
  - [ ] Check if `components/industries/` exists
  - [ ] Check if `components/shared/` exists
  - [ ] Document what needs to move where

- [ ] Audit `app/` routes structure
  - [ ] Check if `app/(platform)/industries/` exists
  - [ ] List all current route groups
  - [ ] Identify any industry-specific routes already created

- [ ] Audit Prisma schema
  - [ ] Check if `Industry` enum exists
  - [ ] Check if `IndustryModule` model exists
  - [ ] Check Organization model for industry fields

### Planning Phase
- [ ] Create detailed refactoring plan for all directories:
  - `lib/industries/` creation
  - `components/` reorganization
  - `app/` route additions
  - Database schema updates
  - Middleware updates

### Documentation Phase
- [ ] Document current state findings in this file
- [ ] Create session-by-session breakdown
- [ ] Identify blockers or dependencies
- [ ] Estimate total number of sessions needed
