- [ ] Commit after each major task
- [ ] Keep commit messages descriptive
- [ ] Don't skip cleanup (beforeEach/afterEach)

### Before Completing
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Generate coverage: `npm run test:coverage`
- [ ] Verify 80%+ coverage achieved
- [ ] Check for flaky tests
- [ ] Update documentation

- [ ] No focused tests (.only)
- [ ] Proper test descriptions
- [ ] Clean, readable test code

## 🔧 Common Issues & Solutions

### Database Connection Failed
**Issue:** Can't connect to test database
**Solution:**
- Verify PostgreSQL is running
- Check DATABASE_URL in .env.test
- Ensure database exists
- Check firewall/network settings

### Prisma Client Not Found
**Issue:** `Cannot find module '@prisma/client'`
**Solution:**
- Run `npx prisma generate`
- Check prisma schema exists
- Verify DATABASE_URL is set

### Tests Timing Out
**Issue:** Tests exceed 5000ms timeout
**Solution:**
- Increase timeout in jest.config.ts
- Check for missing awaits
- Optimize database queries
- Use beforeEach for slow setup

### Coverage Below 80%
**Issue:** Coverage report shows < 80%
**Solution:**
- Identify uncovered lines
- Write tests for Server Actions first
- Add edge case tests
- Test error handling paths

### CI/CD Failing
**Issue:** Tests pass locally but fail in CI
**Solution:**
- Check GitHub Secrets are set
- Verify DATABASE_URL is correct
- Check PostgreSQL service status
- Review workflow logs
