- Responsive layout that works across devices
- Good use of visual hierarchy with icons and colors

### Pain Points Identified
1. **Filter Complexity**: Two-level dropdown system may be overwhelming for some users
2. **No Search Capability**: Users cannot quickly search for specific solutions
3. **Limited Preview Information**: Cards require clicking to see full details
4. **No Comparison Feature**: Cannot compare multiple solutions side-by-side

#### Implementation
```jsx
// Example unified search with smart suggestions
<SearchBar 
  placeholder="Search solutions by industry, type, or keyword..."
  suggestions={intelligentSuggestions}
  onSearch={handleSearch}
/>

// Visual filter chips
<FilterChips 
  categories={['Healthcare', 'AI-Powered', 'Under $10k']}

/>
```
