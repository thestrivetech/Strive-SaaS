Including your standalone chatbot repository into the monolithic Next.js codebase can impact performance—but with careful integration you can minimize any negative effects. Here’s what to watch for and how to optimize:

1. Code Splitting via Dynamic Import  
   -  Lazy-load the chatbot bundle only on the routes that actually use it:  
   ```tsx
   'use client'
   import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'
   const ChatbotWidget = dynamic(() => import('@/chatbot/ChatbotWidget'), {
     ssr: false,
     loading: () => <Spinner />
   })
   ```
   This ensures the chatbot code is pulled in only when needed rather than inflating your initial JS bundle.

2. Move Heavy Logic to Server Components or API Routes  
   -  Anything that doesn’t need to run in the browser—e.g. prompt orchestration, API calls—belongs in Next.js Server Components or API routes under `app/api/chat/`.  
   -  Client-side only gets minimal UI and real-time socket logic.

3. Leverage Edge Functions or Serverless for Real-Time  
   -  If your chatbot uses WebSockets or real-time streams, isolate that in a dedicated edge or serverless function (e.g. under `pages/api/chat/ws.ts`) so it doesn’t bloat your main Lambda container.

4. Optimize Dependencies  
   -  Audit the chatbot’s dependencies and install only the runtime packages you need.  
   -  Replace heavy libraries with lighter alternatives or load them dynamically inside the chatbot component.

5. Bundle Analysis & Performance Budgets  
   -  Run `next build --profile` or use `@next/bundle-analyzer` to validate that adding the chatbot doesn’t push your initial bundle over your 500 KB budget.  
   -  If it does, adjust by extracting more code into dynamic imports.

6. Caching & CDN  
   -  Host static assets (e.g. bot avatars, model files) on your CDN (`public/` folder) to offload delivery from your server.  
   -  Use `Cache-Control` headers for repeated requests.

7. Monitor Core Web Vitals  
   -  After integration, use Vercel Analytics or Web Vitals to ensure metrics like Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and Total Blocking Time (TBT) remain within targets.

8. Use React’s Suspense & Streaming  
   -  Wrap your chatbot in `<Suspense>` to defer rendering until its JS is loaded, keeping your initial page interactive:  
   ```tsx
   <Suspense fallback={<ChatPlaceholder />}>
     <ChatbotWidget />
   </Suspense>
   ```

**Bottom Line**  
Centralizing your chatbot in the Next.js repo will not inherently doom your performance if:  
- You lazy-load it on demand  
- Shift heavy logic to server/API  
- Audit and slim dependencies  
- Monitor and enforce performance budgets

With these practices, you can keep your platform’s pages snappy while offering an integrated chatbot experience.
