**CONTEXT ESTABLISHMENT:**

Please read the following project documents in this exact order to establish full context:

1. `/Users/grant/Documents/GitHub/Strive-SaaS/CLAUDE.md` - Project standards, architecture rules, and development guidelines
2. `/Users/grant/Documents/GitHub/Strive-SaaS/docs/database/session-logs/session1_summary.md` - Complete summary of Session 1 (database audit and documentation)
3. `/Users/grant/Documents/GitHub/Strive-SaaS/docs/database/session-logs/session2_summary.md` - Complete summary of Session 2 (implementation and Supabase deployment)
4. `/Users/grant/Documents/GitHub/Strive-SaaS/docs/database/session-logs/session3_plan.md` - Detailed plan for this session (testing and validation)

**SESSION 3 OBJECTIVE:**

Validate and test all database configuration improvements implemented in Session 2. The infrastructure is now production-ready (Health Score: 95/100), but Session 3 focuses on comprehensive testing, performance monitoring, and final validation.

**WHAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED IN SESSION 2:**
- âœ… Notification model added and operational
- âœ… Duplicate Prisma clients consolidated
- âœ… Realtime table names fixed (snake_case)
- âœ… Drizzle ORM removed
- âœ… Environment validation implemented
- âœ… RLS policies deployed (52 policies on 17 tables)
- âœ… Storage buckets configured (3 buckets with RLS)
- âœ… Modern Supabase client utilities created

**CURRENT STATUS:**
- Health Score: ðŸŸ¢ 95/100 (Excellent)
- RLS: âœ… Deployed and active
- Storage: âœ… Configured with RLS
- Production Ready: âœ… YES

**SESSION 3 TASKS (Optional - Most Critical Work Complete):**

**Phase 1: Comprehensive Testing (~1 hour)**
- Task 1: Test Notification System End-to-End
- Task 2: Test Realtime Subscriptions (All 4 Types)
- Task 3: Test RLS Multi-Tenant Isolation
- Task 4: Test Storage Bucket Operations

**Phase 2: Performance & Monitoring (~30 minutes)**
- Task 5: Query Performance Analysis
- Task 6: Setup Performance Monitoring
- Task 7: RLS Policy Performance Check

**Phase 3: Documentation & Cleanup (~30 minutes)**
- Task 8: Update README with New Features
- Task 9: Create Deployment Checklist
- Task 10: Final Verification & Cleanup

**IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:**

1. **Session 3 is OPTIONAL** - All critical infrastructure is deployed and production-ready
2. **Focus on validation** - Ensure everything works end-to-end
3. **Use TodoWrite tool** to track testing progress
4. **Document test results** in session summary
5. **Create test scripts** for future regression testing
6. **Performance matters** - Check if RLS impacts query speed

**TESTING APPROACH:**

Each test should follow this pattern:
```
1. Setup test data
2. Execute operation
3. Verify expected result
4. Check RLS isolation (if applicable)
5. Cleanup test data
6. Document results
```

**AFTER COMPLETING ALL TASKS:**

1. **Create session summary:** `/Users/grant/Documents/GitHub/Strive-SaaS/docs/database/session-logs/session3_summary.md`
   - Include: All test results, performance metrics, issues found, final health score
   - Reference the template structure from `session1_summary.md` and `session2_summary.md`

2. **Update main README:** `/Users/grant/Documents/GitHub/Strive-SaaS/app/README.md`
   - Add section on new features (notifications, RLS, storage)
   - Document environment variables
   - Include deployment instructions

3. **Create deployment checklist:** `/Users/grant/Documents/GitHub/Strive-SaaS/docs/database/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`
   - Pre-deployment verification steps
   - Post-deployment validation steps
   - Rollback procedures

4. **Assess need for Session 4:**
   - If all tests pass and performance is good: **Project complete** âœ…
   - If enhancements desired: Create `session4_plan.md` for features like:
     - Presence Tracking (Task 3.2 from Session 2)
     - Automated test suite
     - CI/CD pipeline for migrations
     - Database backup automation

**SESSION FLOW:**
This session should follow the pattern:
- Read context â†’ Review what was built â†’ Execute comprehensive tests â†’ Analyze performance â†’ Document results â†’ Declare project complete or plan enhancements

**VERIFICATION COMMANDS TO RUN:**

Before starting tests, verify infrastructure:
```bash
cd app

# 1. Check Prisma schema
npx prisma validate

# 2. Verify RLS policies exist
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public';"
# Expected: 52 policies

# 3. Verify storage buckets
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT name, public FROM storage.buckets ORDER BY name;"
# Expected: attachments, avatars, public-assets

# 4. Verify helper functions
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT proname FROM pg_proc WHERE proname IN ('current_user_org', 'is_admin', 'is_org_owner');"
# Expected: 3 functions

# 5. Check environment validation
npm run dev
# Expected: "âœ… Environment variables validated"
```

**KEY TESTING PRIORITIES:**

1. **RLS Isolation (Critical)** - Ensure no cross-tenant data leaks
2. **Realtime Subscriptions** - Verify events fire correctly
3. **Storage Operations** - Test upload/download/delete
4. **Notification System** - Full CRUD operations
5. **Performance** - Query times acceptable with RLS

**SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR SESSION 3:**

- [ ] All 4 test phases completed
- [ ] No cross-tenant data leaks found
- [ ] Realtime subscriptions working (all 4 types)
- [ ] Storage operations functional
- [ ] Notification CRUD operations working
- [ ] Query performance acceptable (< 200ms for common queries)
- [ ] No RLS permission errors
- [ ] Test scripts created for regression testing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployment checklist created
- [ ] Final health score: 96-100/100

**IF TESTS REVEAL ISSUES:**

1. Document the issue clearly
2. Assess severity (P0/P1/P2)
3. Fix immediately if P0 (blocking)
4. Add to session4_plan.md if P1/P2
5. Update health score accordingly

**QUICK REFERENCE:**

- **Session 1:** Audit and documentation
- **Session 2:** Implementation and deployment (COMPLETE)
- **Session 3:** Testing and validation (THIS SESSION)
- **Session 4:** Enhancements (if needed)

**Ready to begin?** Start with Phase 1, Task 1 from the session3_plan.md - Test Notification System End-to-End.

---

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- Session 2 accomplished MORE than planned - RLS and Storage were deployed in addition to all code changes
- Your system is already production-ready with 95/100 health score
- Session 3 is about confidence through testing, not fixing critical issues
- If all tests pass, you can confidently deploy to production
- Think of this as a "victory lap" to validate the excellent work from Sessions 1 & 2
