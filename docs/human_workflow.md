**Current**: Neon PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM (production-ready)  
**Future**: Supabase migration planned for enhanced real-time and auth features  
**Workflow**: All development considers both current implementation and migration readiness

### ü§ñ **Agent Team Structure (8 Agents)**
1. **Master Orchestrator** - Project coordination & strategic leadership
2. **UI/UX Designer** - User experience & visual design specialist  
3. **Frontend Architect** - React/TypeScript implementation (Context7)
4. **Backend Specialist** - API & business logic (Context7)
5. **Database Specialist** - Neon+Drizzle current, Supabase migration planning (Context7)
6. **DevOps Specialist** - Infrastructure & deployment automation
7. **Evaluator Agent** - Quality assurance & performance analysis
8. **Documentation Agent** - Knowledge management & session continuity
