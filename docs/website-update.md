Fix nav bar for all pages (should be translucent/transparent in the hero section but then carry the hero section gradient color as soon as the nav bar hits the end of the hero section)

- Home Page - 

1. The demo preview video section is still too small on big displays (I think it might look alright for smaller display screens/devices) even after we updated it in the last session, please make sure that it is. Also, the buttons for the arrows on the sides of the demo preview section are not formatted correctly either for bigger displays, we need to fix this. Additionally, I want to only have the side arrows on the left and right of the demo presentation section. I don't want anything around them like the boxes that are currently there. 

2. Please change the "Watch Demos" to "View Demos" in the hero section of the home page which takes them to the demo filtered section in the portfolio. - Completed in last session, looks good.

3. The "Connect With Us" section at the bottom of home page needs to be revamped.

5.  Please make sure to change out the title of the cards/badges in "Connect With Us" section to be more focused on company centered aspects of what it's like to work with us and what it's like to become a partner with strive. 

6. Add discord icon to the footer on all pages which links to Strive's discord: https://discord.gg/q3djnrvP29 

7. “Integrated Business Platform” section needs to be updated or changed. We could cater it to our app/website which gives customers the ability to be in the loop on their project status and oversight with daily snapshots on overall progress and visuals if applicable. - After doing this, please use the existing modal (pop out system) that's used on all other pages on this sections cards/badges.

8. Make “Why Choose Strive” the main text so it pops out rather than being a secondary text 

9. Change “View Success Stories” in Why Choose Strive to - "Meet the Team" Add a orange button outline to the button to match the "View Demos" button at the top of the page

10. The orange "Strive" logo/text in the footer and the nav bar section of the website needs to be changed to this logo (make sure that the appearance looks right formatting wise when you put this logo in):  ![alt text](STRIVE_orange_text_transparent_1500x1500.png)

-Solutions Page-

- Need to change the “By Industry” and “Solution Type” badge underneath the main header text on all solution cards to be more specific to the actual Industry (Healthcare, Tech, Logistics, Law, etc.) and the specific Solution Type (Natural Language Processing "NLP", Computer Vision, Predictive Model, etc.) - 


- Portfolio Page -

Change text in the header to say something that fits the page. It’s a portfolio page. So maybe use “Strive presents…” Or just use the word presents or another word that would look and sound better since this is the text hook for the patch. We need to use the gradient design on keywords in this text header like we did on the Home and Portfolio Page - This was done in last session and I like it for the most part but we need to only have gradient words in the main text header instead of both the main and sub header sections. 

- Fix the badge/card title text color on all badges to be orange instead of white. It currently blends in with the badge/card color - This was done nicely in the last session, good job. Now all that we need to do is change the project type text color to dark blue (#020a1c) and to make sure that all card/badges match in formatting because currently, some of the cards/badges have their "View Details" button lower than others. Let's use the "Computer Vision Analytics" card/badge as the reference and make all other cards formatting and dimensions match that one. Please make sure not to change any of the content within the cards/badge, we are just changing the overall size of the badges to match along with the structuring and layout. 

- Resources Page - 

1. Remove "Knowledge Center" from the hero section and add the bookcase lucid icon in it’s place. It should match what the brain-circuit icon in size (on portfolio page)

2.

(Completed and implemented on Consultation Page, make sure it works)Additionally, we need to have the Calendly window on a page for people to schedule meetings with us instead of going through the entire process of filling out information.
OR, we could ask the user when they would like to meet in the Contact Us form which will automatically schedule them on the Calendly app -> they should receive a confirmation email with the meeting time and date and form of communication (Google Meet, Discord, Phone Call, Microsoft Teams?, etc.)

- Contact Page - 

Change the background of this page to be the gradient design that’s used in all of the hero sections. Make the badges/cards an off white color (#ffffffeb) and the text box color to dark blue (#020a1c). Use the orange color as the text box outline. Make sure that the text color used on all badges/cards don’t blend in with the badge/card color. Make it visually appealing.
In the Quick actions badge/card change the “Live Chat Support” link to open up a window with our ChatBot “Sai” - I will put this ChatBot file into the directory later today. For now just make the page and chat layout with Sai for filler content. Make this new chat page visually appealing as well.
Update the Schedule Consultation page to get more information from the user in regard to their business and what their business does.
Need to fix “Schedule a Demo” button, it doesn’t go to any page. Make it go to the “Get started page” - Unless we want a different page specifically for demo requests so that way we know what the user is reaching out about (will provide more organization)
Change Business Hours to EST

-About Us Page-
Change to “Company”
Create nav bar dropdown to list “Become a Partner, Community (discord and more), Meet the Team, etc. - Think of more areas and pages/sections to add to this page or part of the website - We need to decide whether to make this one entire page broken into different sections or to make it different pages (could make it one page with different pop out screens that go into more detail like on other pages)

- Login Page - 

Add forgot password selection
Make the “Welcome to Strive” badge/card the same color and design of the websites hero section using the same gradient look.

- Get Started Pages - 

- Step 3 of 3 page: please make this card/badge color the same off white color that we use for every other area of white in the project (#ffffffeb) - After doing this, please make sure that this color of white is being used for any white backgorunds that are used. BACKGROUNDS SPECIFICALLY, NOT ANYTHING ELSE.

- Step 3 of 3 page: make the "Last Step" text color the same as the gradient color that's used on all hero sections throughout the website. Additionally, change the button color to this gradient as well.
