### Entire implementation list for the website ###


# Entire Website # Mostly completed, needs review 

# Home Page #

- THE FOLLOWING WAS DONE ON THE SOLTUIONS PAGE BUT NEEDED TO BE DONE ON THE PORTFOLIO PAGE - Create links to each technology badge that takes the user to the specific document that has been created to explain what each thing is. If it's a industry, take them to a case study that's been created about that specific industry  - Make filler cards for all technology badges mentioned on the Portfolio page (they are mentioned on each Portfolio card) these links on the Resources page in the Tech/tools filtered section - Please remove the technology pages from the solutions pages and lets come up with a different way to help users/clients understand each solution and solution type

# Solutions Page #

- 

# Resources Page #


-  Add another filter button - "Tools & Tech" with a wrench icon - This is where all technologies and tools that are mentioned on any card on the Portfolio page should be. All technology buttons should have a card in this new section and should be linked with it's certain badge on the Portfolio page

# Contact Page #

- Change the background of this page to be the gradient design that’s used in all of the hero sections. Make the cards on this page an off white color (#ffffffeb) and the text box color to dark blue (#020a1c). Use the orange color as the text box outline. Make sure that the text color used on all badges/cards don’t blend in with the badge/card color. Make it visually appealing.

- In the Quick actions badge/card change the “Live Chat Support” link to open up a window with our ChatBot “Sai” - I will put this ChatBot file into the directory later today. For now just make the page and chat layout with Sai for filler content. Make this new chat page visually appealing as well.

- Update the Schedule Consultation page to get more information from the user in regard to their business and what their business does.
Need to fix “Schedule a Demo” button, it doesn’t go to any page. Make it go to the “Get started page” - Unless we want a different page specifically for demo requests so that way we know what the user is reaching out about (will provide more organization)

- Change Business Hours to EST

# About Us Page # 
Change to “Company”
Create nav bar dropdown to list “Become a Partner, Community (discord and more), Meet the Team, etc. - Think of more areas and pages/sections to add to this page or part of the website - We need to decide whether to make this one entire page broken into different sections or to make it different pages (could make it one page with different pop out screens that go into more detail like on other pages)

# Login Page #

Add forgot password selection
Make the “Welcome to Strive” badge/card the same color and design of the websites hero section using the same gradient look.

# Get Started Pages # 

- Step 3 of 3 page: please make this card/badge color the same off white color that we use for every other area of white in the project (#ffffffeb) 

- Step 3 of 3 page: make the "Last Step" text color the same as the gradient color that's used on all hero sections throughout the website. Additionally, change the button color to this gradient as well.

# Request Demo Section #

- Take out the hero section for this page, it's not a feature page so it's not needed

- Use hero section gradient color for main text header on the page

- Fix color layout of this page - 

# Mobile Design List #

- Make mobile specific design way more mobile centric - example: "What's New with Strive?" section should have a scroll feature where the different cards can be rotate horizontally

- Make ROI calculator one card where the user can see everything

- Remove demo preview dots in home page hero section (only remove them on mobile or smaller )
