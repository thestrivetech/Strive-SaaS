# Company Page # - Haven't implemented yet - Needs refinement

- Create nav bar dropdown to list â€œBecome a Partner, Community (discord and more), Meet the Team, etc. - Think of more areas and pages/sections to add to this page or part of the website - We need to decide whether to make this one entire page broken into different sections or to make it different pages (could make it one page with different pop out screens that go into more detail like on other pages)

- (optional) Make each "Visionary" / Employee card have the same pop out functionality that exists on the other pages - This will be a pop out card that gives further detail on each individual
