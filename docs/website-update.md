### Entire implementation list for the website ###

# Entire Website # 

- Add small but noticable "Coming Soon" banner to "Chat Live with AI Specialist" button (Contact page) & "TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND CONTROL" section (Home page) & the actual sign in / sign up pages (coming October 1st, 2025)

- Remove any double hyphens on the website - Make sure the sentences that are edited still make sense after doing this (don't change entire sentences, just make small tweaks to make the sentences make sense)

- Make sure that all routing is set up for when people send contact information or sign up for any type of meeting - We should all 3 recieve an email (plus Strive's contact email) - Here's the emails that should recieve the notification: 
    garrettholland@strivetech.ai
    jeffmeyer@strivetech.ai
    grantramey@strivetech.ai
    contact@strivetech.ai

- Use company email for any legal or customer support requests or anything else: contact@strivetech.ai

- Change all photos / pics out for photos that are relevant to what the photo is used for

- Change company address anywhere that it's used to: Nashville, TN
  - Same goes for Phone number: (731)-431-2320

# Home Page #


- Need to fix ROI calculator to be more accurate (Use verified statistics through verified high quality sources and cite the source in the calculator section) - Also need to scale down the total investment to $500k max instead of $1M (Might need to change copy on this page to match this change after this is updated) - Also need to lower the total investment amount on ROI calculator - Move it down to be a maximum of $250,000 and a minimum of $1,000

- Add all industries from the solutions page into the ROI dropdown and also give the user the ability to type in a industry
  - Additonally, please tell the user (the chat user, not the website user) of any additional industries that should be added that aren't already on the website

- Fix button end points after copy is finalized

- (MAYBE) We also want to advertise that we create different levels of automation on the home page for any company need or want - We want to still express the importance of humans rather than appearing to be fully "AI positive," because many people are still skeptical of AI and it taking jobs away from people.
  - Here's our automation levels:
    - Level 1: Straight software with no automation- Pure human
Level 2: Human workflow w/ AI assistance & eval (Strive is here)
Level 3: Human directed AI workflow & Step by step Human monitoring/eval
Level 4: Mostly autonomous workflow/system/software - Step by step agentic monitoring & eval -> End of workflow human eval
YOLO 5: Fully automated system and workflow - Human eval at end of each day or human decided review frequency

- "TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND CONTROL" section is where we are advertising our fully integrated "Business HUB" that will be released soon (October 1st, 2025) - This will give clients and users the ability to view project progress (progress bar and snapshots when project is updated by Strive team, & clients can also leave comments if they want for feedback on certain things) - I like the existing header and subheader text... Maybe give "Strive client portal" the orange gradient color that's used for other text in the hero section
  - Try and make the cards not look so plain in this section

- ROI calculator button needs to be changed to "Request Solution Showcase"

- Make sure the "AI SOLUTIONS TAILORED TO YOUR INDUSTRY'S BIGGEST CHALLENGES" sections statistics and are accurate and that we have high quality sources to back the statistics
 

# Solutions Page #

- Deselect option on industry and solution type filter (should be able to click back on the filter item that was selected in the dropdown menu to deselect it)
Upgrade visuals on Solutions page to be on par with Portfolio

- Number that shows the total number of industries and solutions that are available in the filter isn't functioning properly

- "Speak with an AI specialist" maybe needs to go back to "Get Custom Solution?"

- Add Solution type: Offline Solutions / Local solutions - which is for all solutions that can operate locally on clients own hardware if they're hardware can handle it. - Make the actual card production ready and make sure that it matches the writing style and tone of the other solution cards - Add types of solutions that can actually be ran offline / locally
  - Slogan for locally ran solutions: If you have the hardware, we'll build you the software.

- Add the gaming industry - Make sure to create more specific AI solutions for this industry as well

- Add the eSports industry - Make sure to create more specific AI solutions for this industry as well


# Portfolio Page #

- The text in the hero section doesn't really have anything to do with the page being a portfolio... Is this ok?

# Resources Page #

- The bottom of the G in "Intelligence" is slightly hidden in the hero section

- Please make the filter buttons the same color scheme and hover color effect as the portfolio pages filter buttons

- Remove gradient color from the "Resource Library"

- When I click the back button going back to the resource page from clicking the "Unlock Actionable Insights" (takes me to the contact page) - Is this a bug?

# Company Page # - Haven't implemented yet - Needs refinement

- Create nav bar dropdown to list â€œBecome a Partner, Community (discord and more), Meet the Team, etc. - Think of more areas and pages/sections to add to this page or part of the website - We need to decide whether to make this one entire page broken into different sections or to make it different pages (could make it one page with different pop out screens that go into more detail like on other pages)

- Maybe change the header text to something more specific about this being our Company page? But still hooking the users attention or making them want to work with us?

# Contact Page #

- 

# Login Page #

- Please make all text color dark blue for the text above each text box

# Schedule Assessment Page #

- Change text above the text boxes to dark blue that's used on the site

- Change "Contact Information" to orange that's used on the site

- Have error message pop up if the email isn't an actual email and the same goes for the phone number

# Request Pages # 
### Request Demo / Request Solution Page and 'steps' subpages ###

- Fix the formatting of the "3 Steps" - Make the step bubbles and text align (each bubble should be aligned with the middle of the actual text)

- Change wording on "Request Recieved" page from to be more specific the process and timeline of the showcase

- On step 3 card, please change the gradient color of the "Submit Request" button to use the orange in the text gradient. Leave the purple in the middle but just change out the orange.
  - Add another lightning bolt icon to the other side of the text on the submit button

- Change background color used in the user details box (located right below the calendly window) to match the off white background color
  - Change text color inside mentioned above text box to be orange and dark blue (orange used for the: Your Details, Contact, Email, Company, and dark blue is used for users/clients actual information)


# Mobile Design List #

- Make mobile specific design way more mobile centric - example: "What's New with Strive?" section should have a scroll feature where the different cards can be rotate horizontally

- Make ROI calculator one card where the user can see everything when adjusting the sliding bar

- Remove demo preview dots in home page hero section (only remove them on mobile or smaller displays)

- Make the arrows for the demo preview section (home page) on the inside of the actual display area, its currently below the demo display area - Make sure this doesnt block the view of the actual demo preview.
