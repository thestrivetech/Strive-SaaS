### Entire implementation list for the website ###

- 

# Entire Website # 

- 

# Home Page #

- Remove warning and caution sign symbols from the page, this angle and visual makes us look look like scammers and unprofessional - Remove the "⚠️ WARNING: Every day you delay costs you $5,000+ in lost opportunities" red section

- Change "Manual Processes Cost You $2M+ Annually" to something more vague instead of using a specific number since we will be working with different sized companies. Could say "Manual Processes Costs you Thousands of Dollars, if not More"

- Need to fix "Choose Your Future: AI Leadership or Manual Mediocrity" section to not be so rude - This seems pushy and also has the "scammer" feel.

- Completely remove "The Cost of Staying Manual" badge - This is completely unessecary

- Need to fix ROI calculator to be more accurate (Use verified statistics through verified high quality sources and cite the source in the calculator section) - Also need to scale down the total investment to $500k max instead of $1M (Might need to change copy on this page to match this change after this is updated)

- Need to fix cards and badges to all match in size (section dependent and size match)

- Fix button end points after copy is finalized 

- Fix copy in the "WE UNDERSTAND THE PRESSURE YOU'RE UNDER" section to be more applicable to our actual situation (we haven't helped anyone yet or worked with any clients). Instead, use verified statistics of how many companies are implementing AI into their business - Additionally provide verified statistics on how AI is earning or saving companies more money.

- We also want to advertise that we create different levels of automation on the home page for any company need or want - We want to still express the importance of humans rather than appearing to be fully "AI positive," because many people are still skeptical of AI and it taking jobs away from people.
  - Here's our automation levels:
    - Level 1: Straight software with no automation- Pure human 
Level 2: Human workflow w/ AI assistance & eval (Strive is here)
Level 3: Human directed AI workflow & Step by step Human monitoring/eval
Level 4: Mostly autonomous workflow/system/software - Step by step agentic monitoring & eval -> End of workflow human eval
YOLO 5: Fully automated system and workflow - Human eval at end of each day or human decided review frequency

- Deselect option on industry and solution type filter (should be able to click back on the filter item that was selected in the dropdown menu to deselect it)
Upgrade visuals on Solutions page to be on par with Portfolio


# Portfolio Page #

- 

# Resources Page #

- 

# Company Page # - Haven't implemented yet - Needs refinement

- Create nav bar dropdown to list “Become a Partner, Community (discord and more), Meet the Team, etc. - Think of more areas and pages/sections to add to this page or part of the website - We need to decide whether to make this one entire page broken into different sections or to make it different pages (could make it one page with different pop out screens that go into more detail like on other pages)

- (optional) Make each "Visionary" / Employee card have the same pop out functionality that exists on the other pages - This will be a pop out card that gives further detail on each individual

- Change wording on "Request Recieved" page from to be more specific the process and timeline of the showcase


# Mobile Design List #

- Make mobile specific design way more mobile centric - example: "What's New with Strive?" section should have a scroll feature where the different cards can be rotate horizontally

- Make ROI calculator one card where the user can see everything when adjusting the sliding bar

- Remove demo preview dots in home page hero section (only remove them on mobile or smaller displays)
