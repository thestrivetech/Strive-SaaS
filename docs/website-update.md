### Entire implementation list for the website ###


# Entire Website # All COMPLETED 
- Fix nav bar for all pages (should be translucent/transparent in the hero section but then carry the hero section gradient color as soon as the nav bar hits the end of the hero section)

- The orange "Strive" logo/text in the footer and the nav bar section of the website needs to be changed to this logo (make sure that the appearance looks right formatting wise when you put this logo in):  ![alt text](STRIVE_orange_text_transparent_1500x1500.png)

- Make sure that the color of orange that's in the new logo is now the color of orange that's used on the entire website (only existing areas using orange, don't change another areas that's not using the color orange)

- Please make sure that the off color of white (#ffffffeb) is being used for any white backgorunds that are used on the website. BACKGROUNDS SPECIFICALLY, NOT ANYTHING ELSE.

### Still need to reformat wording to achvieve what's mentioned below ###
- Make sure that each pages hero section (excluding the home page) aligns the same when users enter the page. The Home page is the only exception with how it takes up the whole screen when users first enter the site.

- Change the hero section buttons on all pages to match the home page buttons layout (maybe add some really unique white buttons with cool animations?)

# Home Page # 

- Home page - The play/pause button in the demo preview should disappear after the user clicks the play button and the videos begin to play. Make sure the demos are paused whenever the user enters the website - Additionally 

- Home page - Change "YOUR PROJECT DASHBOARD" sections cards to white (just like the cards on the Portfolio page) & format the icons better

- Home page - Remove connect with us section but leave the bottom "Get Started In Just 15 minutes" card 

- Home page - update emoji icons in solutions by industry section that are used back to the lucid icons

# Solutions Page #

- Add things to make this page more simple for the user experience - Ask me before actually updating the page in a specific way

- Fix filter display and button functionality and color scheme
  - Filter dropdown menu sould only dropdown below the industry and solution type buttons - Currently it appears above the buttons if the users screen is above that section
  - Once a filter button is selected for the user to choose a filter option, in order to go back to all, they should have to click the "All" button next to the other two filters
  - "Industry" needs to be the default word on the industry filter button - Then it should change to the specific industry name when the user selects their industry to filter by
  - Color of words and icons in both filter dropdown menus are fine but I want to make the word and icon color change to orange on hover.

- Add text above the filter section that says something like, "Use the filter to find your  industry specific solution!"

- Use gradient text color on the word "Every" in hero section

- Change button colors in the hero section to match button scheme on home page

- Create links to each technology badge that takes the user to the specific document that has been created to explain what each thing is. If it's an industry, take them to a case study that's been created about that specific industry - Make sure to create badge hover effects to so they will know they can click on them (unless this is too much, then we would just give them the option to click on the badges once the card is clicked on and it pops out) - Go ahead and make filler cards for these links on the Resources page

- Please change the h3 text color for all cards to be orange instead of white (it currently blends in)

# Portfolio Page #

- Please use the exact hero section design on the Portfolio page and add it to the following pages: Solutions, Resources, and About Me - After doing this, make the Solutions page lightbulb icon flash exactly like the brain circut icon on the portfolio page - Done? Looks like the slight sparkle/glimmer affect was removed?

Change text in the header to say: "Solutions that give you more time to do what you love". Use the gradient design on the words "AI Solutions" in this text header section 

- Fix the badge/card title text color on all badges to be orange instead of white. It currently blends in with the badge/card color
- 
- Change the project type text color to dark blue (#020a1c) and to make sure that all card/badges match in formatting because currently, some of the cards/badges have their "View Details" button lower than others. Let's use the "Computer Vision Analytics" card/badge as the reference and make all other cards formatting and dimensions match that one. Please make sure not to change any of the content within the cards/badge, we are just changing the overall size of the badges to match along with the structuring and layout. 

# Resources Page #


-  Add another filter button - "Tools & Tech" with a wrench icon - This is where all technologies and tools that are mentioned on any card on the Portfolio page should be. All technology buttons should have a card in this new section and should be linked with it's certain badge on the Portfolio page

# Contact Page #

- Change the background of this page to be the gradient design that’s used in all of the hero sections. Make the cards on this page an off white color (#ffffffeb) and the text box color to dark blue (#020a1c). Use the orange color as the text box outline. Make sure that the text color used on all badges/cards don’t blend in with the badge/card color. Make it visually appealing.

- In the Quick actions badge/card change the “Live Chat Support” link to open up a window with our ChatBot “Sai” - I will put this ChatBot file into the directory later today. For now just make the page and chat layout with Sai for filler content. Make this new chat page visually appealing as well.

- Update the Schedule Consultation page to get more information from the user in regard to their business and what their business does.
Need to fix “Schedule a Demo” button, it doesn’t go to any page. Make it go to the “Get started page” - Unless we want a different page specifically for demo requests so that way we know what the user is reaching out about (will provide more organization)

- Change Business Hours to EST

# About Us Page # 
Change to “Company”
Create nav bar dropdown to list “Become a Partner, Community (discord and more), Meet the Team, etc. - Think of more areas and pages/sections to add to this page or part of the website - We need to decide whether to make this one entire page broken into different sections or to make it different pages (could make it one page with different pop out screens that go into more detail like on other pages)

# Login Page #

Add forgot password selection
Make the “Welcome to Strive” badge/card the same color and design of the websites hero section using the same gradient look.

# Get Started Pages # 

- Step 3 of 3 page: please make this card/badge color the same off white color that we use for every other area of white in the project (#ffffffeb) 

- Step 3 of 3 page: make the "Last Step" text color the same as the gradient color that's used on all hero sections throughout the website. Additionally, change the button color to this gradient as well.



# Mobile Design List #

- Make mobile specific design way more mobile centric - example: "What's New with Strive?" section should have a scroll feature where the different cards can be rotate horizontally

- Make ROI calculator one card where the user can see everything

- Remove demo preview dots in home page hero section
