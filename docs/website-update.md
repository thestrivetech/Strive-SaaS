### Entire implementation list for the website ###


# Entire Website # 



# Home Page #


# Solutions Page #



# Portfolio Page #



# Resources Page #



# Company Page # - Haven't implemented yet - Needs refinement

- Create nav bar dropdown to list “Become a Partner, Community (discord and more), Meet the Team, etc. - Think of more areas and pages/sections to add to this page or part of the website - We need to decide whether to make this one entire page broken into different sections or to make it different pages (could make it one page with different pop out screens that go into more detail like on other pages)

# Contact Page #

- Please copy the card text box color scheme and style on the step 3 "Get Started" page - Do this for the Login and Sign up text boxes as well

- Change text color that's above each text box to orange

- Change "Get in touch" to "Let's Connect" and make the word "Connect" the same gradient color that is used for other words in hero sections across the site.

- Supposedly the chatbot page was made in a earlier session but it's not linked to the "Live chat support" button on the Contact Page

- Update the Schedule Consultation page to get more information from the user in regard to their business and what their business does.
Need to fix “Schedule a Demo” button, it doesn’t go to any page. Make it go to the “Get started page” - Unless we want a different page specifically for demo requests so that way we know what the user is reaching out about (will provide more organization)

- Change Business Hours 8am to 8pm est

- "Schedule a Consultation" take out the "a" in this buttons text

- Make "Schedule a Consultation" have the same shiny hover effect as the "Get Started" button on the home page hero section

- Change "Ready to transform your business?" to "Ready to make your business Strive?" - Or something like that

- Give all other buttons the same hover effects to the corresponding color scheme as the other buttons on the website


# Login Page #

- Give users the ability to login via username or email instead of only by username

- Also make users give their first and last name when they are creating an account / signing up

# Schedule Consultation Page #

- Make the background of this page the same gradient background of the Contact page and use the same exact color scheme for the card and text boxes as well

# Get Started Pages # 



# Request Demo Section #

- Please make the card text box color scheme on all steps of this section the same as step 3 of 3 "Get Started" page

- On step 2 card, we need to give the customer the option to type in their industry if they select "Other"

- On step 3 card, we need to add "Other" choice for the user to type in additional demo focus areas

# Mobile Design List #

- Make mobile specific design way more mobile centric - example: "What's New with Strive?" section should have a scroll feature where the different cards can be rotate horizontally

- Make ROI calculator one card where the user can see everything

- Remove demo preview dots in home page hero section (only remove them on mobile or smaller )
