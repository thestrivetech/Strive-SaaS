- Here are precise, actionable instructions for improving the mobile design and user experience of your B2B AI Solutions website. These suggestions are based on a page-by-page analysis in mobile/responsive view, focusing on readability, navigation, conversion optimization, and overall mobile usability.

# General (for All Pages) # 
Navigation/Menu:

Use a sticky hamburger menu for quick access.

Ensure the menu covers the full height with clear tap targets.

Keep navigation 1–2 taps from any page.

# Spacing & Text #

Increase vertical spacing between sections, headings, and CTAs.

Use 18–20px font for body text, 28–36px for headings.

Add generous padding to all buttons and CTAs (at least 16px).

Never rely on hover states, use clear, visible states for all interactive elements.

# Imagery & Features #

Compress images for mobile, use aspect ratios that don’t crop content or cause awkward white space.

Place essential CTAs above the first scroll (top 60% of the screen).

Make all carousels swipeable, not arrows.

# Performance #

Optimize all graphics for mobile and minimize animation or video auto-play above the fold.

Use lazy loading for long resource sections.

# Page-by-Page Recommendations #
1. Homepage
Hero Section

Reduce text and place headline, value sub-headline, CTA in a vertical stack.

Make the CTA a large button that spans 80–90% of the screen width.

Video/demo (if present) should be mobile-optimized, paused by default, tap-to-play with a clear overlay.

ROI Calculator

Stack each input vertically (industry, investment, solutions) instead of a grid.

Use drop-downs and simple slider controls with large tap targets.

Results section should use big numbers, icons, and bold branding color (not just text).

Solutions by Industry

Use a scrollable card system—one card per industry, full-width on mobile.

Make industry names and summaries large, with a clear “learn more” button.

Avoid showing too many choices at once; allow users to swipe or scroll horizontally.

Project Dashboard/Features

Each feature (e.g., Project Management, BI, Automation) should be a collapsible accordion or card with a “View Details” button.

Give each feature a recognizable simple icon to help visual scanning.

Why Strive / Trust Signals

Show stats/testimonials in a stacked card or carousel (one visible at a time).

Use bold stats and real quotes; each should fill most of the mobile viewport.

Product Updates / Resources Strip

Display one news/resource item per line with a small image or icon, headline, and short description.

“View all resources” should be a large button at the bottom.

Sticky CTA Footer

Add a sticky footer “Book A Free AI Strategy Call” button visible at all times after the first scroll.

# 2. Solutions Page
Filter/Industry Selector

Use a dropdown at the top or swipeable horizontal industry chips.

Show one solution or industry group per view; avoid multiple columns.

Solution Cards

Use large clickable cards with icons, short headline/description, and one “See Details” CTA per card.

Collapse extra details vertically to avoid infinite scrolling.

# 3. Resources Page
Resource Filters

Collapsible filter/issues bar fixed at the top as the user scrolls.

List resources as big tap-friendly blocks; cards should include type (case study/blog/whitepaper), short summary, and a “Read/Download” button.

CTA/Newsletter Sign-Up

Prominent single-field email entry, not multi-field, with a bold sign-up button.

Explain value (“Get top AI business tips weekly”).

# 4. Portfolio / Demo Page
Demo/Template Cards

Full-width tiles for each AI demo or template, with a preview image, bold headline, and tap-to-expand full details.

Tech Tags/Metadata

Stack all tags/tech as a wrapped row or chips under each item; don’t show as floating or in columns.

# 5. About / CompanyPage
Stats/Clients

Present company stats (clients, retention) as large, graphical “data cards.”

Timeline / Roadmap

Convert roadmap into a vertical scrollable timeline with dots for each event, highlighting the next big milestone.

Leadership

Display team members in single-column cards with name, photo, and key highlights.

Mission, Vision, Values

Use collapsible sections for each value or present in a stacked format with clear separation.

Final CTA

End pages with a single strong CTA: “Speak With An Expert” — large and sticky.

# Common Mobile Pain Points to Fix #
Eliminate side-by-side columns (stack them vertically).

Increase all touch targets to at least 48x48 px.

Avoid tiny icons or microscopic badge text.

Make every CTA and navigation action one easy, obvious tap.

Ensure all forms are single-column, with auto-complete enabled.

Touch-First Usability
Test every button, link, and slider with your thumb: nothing should be hard to tap.

Avoid long-scroll fatigue by breaking up content and adding section headers/shadows.
