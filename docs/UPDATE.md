The website is currently live on vercerl and I keep getting errors when I click a bunch of the buttons... The error reads: 500: INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR Code: FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED ID: iad1::5ng26-1757611362973-9ce62a0f6b40 Many other error ID's are popping up as well when different buttons are being clicked

Also getting an error when I refresh the page
