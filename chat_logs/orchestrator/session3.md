## Inter-Agent Communication

### Context7 MCP Server Usage Pattern
All architect agents must properly understand:
- Context7 = MCP server for library documentation
- Use `mcp__context7__resolve_library_id` for library lookups
- Use `mcp__context7__get_library_docs` for documentation
- Backend, Database, DevOps, Test agents may need Context7 MCP integration

### Agent Coordination
- **Main Claude Instructions**: Direct coordination as orchestrator with 7-agent parallel workflow
- **Task Distribution**: Main Claude Code session manages all specialized agents directly
- **Communication Pattern**: Simplified workflow with immediate agent access and delegation

## Context Preservation

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Session Continuity**: Successfully continuing from Session 2 with complete task context - All requirements preserved
2. **Documentation Priority**: Critical memory system and agent documentation must be updated first - Foundation for all future work
3. **Infrastructure Implementation**: Following plan.md blueprint for systematic technical improvements - Strategic approach

### Active Variables
- **Documentation Status**: Agent README and memory.json need complete updates - Critical for workflow efficiency
- **Infrastructure Status**: Security, testing, automation pending implementation - From plan.md requirements  
- **Development Standards**: Line limits and coding patterns need establishment - Based on existing codebase analysis

### Dependencies
- **Internal**: 
  - Agent files in `.claude/agents/` (7 agents - README needs complete rewrite)
  - Memory system in `.claude/memory.json` (placeholder content - needs project specifics)
  - Chat logs in `/chat_logs/orchestrator/` (session1.md, session2.md, session3.md in progress)
  - Development rules in `docs/development/dev_rules.md` (needs line limit analysis)
- **External**: 
  - Context7 MCP server (verify integration status for all coding agents)
  - Serena MCP server - Main Claude Code for intelligent search (active)
  - Playwright MCP - Frontend Architect & UI/UX Agent for testing (active)
- **Blockers**: NONE - All systems operational

### File System Changes  
- **Session 3 Files Created**: 
  - chat_logs/orchestrator/session3.md (comprehensive session log with all context)
- **Session 3 Files To Modify**:
  - .claude/memory.json (complete rewrite with project-specific details)
  - .claude/agents/README.md (complete rewrite for Strive Website 7-agent system)
  - docs/development/dev_rules.md (line limit updates based on codebase analysis)
  - Additional files as per plan.md implementation requirements
- **Previous Sessions Verified**: 
  - Session 1: 17 tasks completed (8-agent to 7-agent transformation)
  - Session 2: 15 tasks completed (documentation updates and blueprint creation)
- **Architecture Status**: 
  - 7-agent parallel workflow fully documented and operational
