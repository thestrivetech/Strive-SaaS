## Inter-Agent Communication

### Context7 MCP Server Usage Pattern
All architect agents now properly understand:
- Context7 = MCP server for library documentation
- Use `mcp__context7__resolve_library_id` for library lookups
- Use `mcp__context7__get_library_docs` for documentation
- Development rules are separate (in `.claude/agent_docs/rules/development_rules.md`)

### Agent Coordination
- **Main Claude Instructions**: Direct coordination without subagent intermediary - ACTIVE
- **Task Distribution**: Main Claude Code session manages all specialized agents directly
- **Communication Pattern**: Simplified workflow with immediate agent access and delegation

## Context Preservation

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Session Continuity**: Successfully bridged compacted session using comprehensive export files - Ensures no context loss
2. **Verification Strategy**: Complete work verification before new tasks - Validates previous session success  
3. **Documentation Standard**: Maintained detailed session logging template - Provides excellent handoff continuity

### Active Variables
- **Documentation Architecture**: Fully transformed to 7-agent system - Complete consistency achieved
- **MCP Tool Assignments**: Properly distributed across agent specializations - Enhanced capabilities active
- **Session State**: Ready for development tasks - All foundational work completed

### Dependencies
- **Internal**: 
  - Agent files in `.claude/agents/` (7 agents configured)
  - Documentation in `.claude/agent_docs/` (updated for new workflow)
  - Chat logs in `/chat_logs/orchestrator/` (session1.md and session2.md)
- **External**: 
  - Context7 MCP server (via mcp__context7__ tools) - All coding agents
  - Serena MCP server - Main Claude Code for intelligent search  
  - Playwright MCP - Frontend Architect & UI/UX Agent for testing
- **Blockers**: NONE - All dependencies operational

### File System Changes  
- **Session 2 Files Created**: 
  - chat_logs/orchestrator/session2.md (comprehensive session log)
- **Session 2 Files Modified**:
  - docs/development/dev_rules.md (comprehensive update for Strive Website project)
  - docs/development/development_plan.md (complete overhaul for website context)
- **Previous Session Verified**: 
  - 15 files modified (AGENT_WORKFLOW.md, CLAUDE.md, frontend-architect.md, various docs/*)
  - 2 files deleted (evaluator agent files)  
  - 1 file created (session1.md)
- **Architecture Changes**: 7-agent direct communication model fully operational
