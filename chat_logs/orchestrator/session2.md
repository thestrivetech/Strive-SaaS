- Use `mcp__context7__get_library_docs` for documentation
- Development rules are separate (in `.claude/agent_docs/rules/development_rules.md`)

### Agent Coordination
- **Main Claude Instructions**: Direct coordination without subagent intermediary - ACTIVE
- **Task Distribution**: Main Claude Code session manages all specialized agents directly
- **Communication Pattern**: Simplified workflow with immediate agent access and delegation

## Context Preservation

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Session Continuity**: Successfully bridged compacted session using comprehensive export files - Ensures no context loss
2. **Verification Strategy**: Complete work verification before new tasks - Validates previous session success

All foundational work is complete - time to build technical excellence.
- Once this is done, please view the plan.md file here for improving the agentic system & workflow: C:\Users\zochr\Desktop\GitHub\Strive_Website_Replit\updates\plan.md 
- Once the agentic system and workflow has been updated and is up to par, we need to update this file: C:\Users\zochr\Desktop\GitHub\Strive_Website_Replit\.claude\agents\README.md because it is from a different project and doesn't have any information on how this agentic system works for this specific project
- Read and update this file: C:\Users\zochr\Desktop\GitHub\Strive_Website_Replit\.claude\memory.json to serve it's purpose. I've imported a different memory file (C:\Users\zochr\Desktop\GitHub\Strive_Website_Replit\.claude\memory.json_example) from another session to give some insight on what it should look like and function, but I would really like to establish a better system so all important files are listed and act as a directory so claude, the orchestrator, doesn't have to search in every session to then start giving agents instructions on where certain files are located. Maybe we could even implement memory.json files for each agent that would also function in the same way? Then claude (main orchestrator) could update when needed? I don't want it to look or act in the same exact way, so just use it for context and follow the instructions found within the existing memory.json file (in this projects .claude folder, not the imported one which is for reference and inspiration) for guidance on how to set it up.
- The development rules file here: C:\Users\zochr\Desktop\GitHub\Strive_Website_Replit\docs\development\dev_rules.md needs to be updated to follow the already establshed pattern of coding rules. There still needs to be a line limit on the amount of code. Can analyze all exisiting code to make the best judgement. This dev-rules file is one of the most critical parts to the workflow so please do not be lazy in doing this.
