## Inter-Agent Communication

### Critical Workflow Issue Context
From Session 3 analysis, the core problem identified:
- **memory.json misuse**: Being used as task list and session log instead of central brain
- **plan.md not updated**: Completed tasks not marked as done, creating confusion
- **change_log.md not used**: Code changes undocumented, no rollback capability
- **documentation workflow broken**: Wrong files for wrong purposes

### Correct File Purpose Matrix (Must Be Implemented)
| File | Correct Purpose | Wrong Usage (Current) |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| `memory.json` | Central brain (rules/reminders) | Task lists, session logs |  
| `chat_logs/` | Session work documentation | Memory storage |
| `change_log.md` | Code change tracking | Ignored |
| `plan.md` | Living implementation progress | Static document |

### Agent Coordination
- **Main Claude Instructions**: Direct coordination as orchestrator focusing on workflow system fix
- **Task Distribution**: Sequential workflow fix implementation with systematic verification
- **Communication Pattern**: Solo implementation with detailed documentation for future agent coordination

## Context Preservation

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Workflow Fix Priority**: Session 3 infrastructure was 100% complete, but workflow issue is session-breaking - Must fix before any new work
2. **Memory.json Transformation**: Complete refactor from 564-line task tracker to concise central brain with workflow rules - Critical for system sustainability
3. **Documentation System**: Clear file purpose separation with automated compliance checking - Foundation for all future sessions

### Active Variables
- **Documentation Status**: Session 3 identified memory.json contains wrong content type - Needs complete brain refactor
- **Infrastructure Status**: All critical infrastructure complete (security, testing, automation, CI/CD, performance) - Ready for next phase  
- **Workflow Status**: Broken due to file purpose confusion - This session fixes it permanently

### Dependencies
- **Internal**: 
  - Chat logs in `/chat_logs/orchestrator/` (session3.md, session3_critical_workflow_issue.md context)
  - Memory system in `.claude/memory.json` (currently broken - being fixed)
  - Documentation files (CLAUDE.md needs workflow rules)
  - Automation scripts (`scripts/session-init.ts` needs compliance checking)
- **External**: 
  - Context7 MCP server (all agents properly configured in Session 3)
  - Serena MCP server - Main Claude Code for intelligent search (active)
  - Playwright MCP - Frontend Architect & UI/UX Agent (active)
- **Blockers**: NONE - Workflow fix in progress

### File System Changes  
- **Session 4 Files Created**: 
  - chat_logs/orchestrator/session4.md (this comprehensive session log)
- **Session 4 Files To Transform**:
  - .claude/memory.json (complete brain refactor - remove task lists, add workflow rules)
  - CLAUDE.md (add workflow rules matrix and file purpose definitions)
  - scripts/session-init.ts (add workflow compliance checking)
- **Previous Session Status**: 
  - Session 3: Infrastructure implementation 100% complete, workflow fix 60% complete
  - Critical workflow issue identified and documented
  - memory.json brain refactor NOT completed (highest priority)
