# CRITICAL WORKFLOW ISSUE DOCUMENTATION - SESSION 3
**Time**: 2025-01-03 16:45:00 UTC  
**Severity**: HIGH - Workflow Breaking Issue  
**Impact**: All future sessions affected

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL WORKFLOW PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED

### 1. Memory.json Misuse
- **PROBLEM**: Memory.json being used as a chat log and task list
- **IMPACT**: File bloated with implementation details instead of serving as central brain
- **CORRECT PURPOSE**: Should ONLY contain rules and reminders for session starts
- **ACTION REQUIRED**: Complete refactoring to brain/memory model

### 2. Plan.md Not Being Updated
- **PROBLEM**: Completed tasks in plan.md not marked as done
- **IMPACT**: Duplicate work, unclear progress tracking
- **CORRECT PURPOSE**: Living document tracking implementation progress
- **ACTION REQUIRED**: Update after every completed phase

### 3. Change_log.md Not Being Used
- **PROBLEM**: Code changes not documented in change_log.md
- **IMPACT**: No rollback capability, no change history
- **CORRECT PURPOSE**: Track all edits/deletions with before/after states
- **ACTION REQUIRED**: Document all infrastructure changes made today

### 4. Documentation Workflow Broken
- **PROBLEM**: Wrong files being used for wrong purposes
- **IMPACT**: Context lost, inefficient handoffs, repeated instructions
- **CORRECT WORKFLOW**:
  - memory.json = Brain (rules/reminders)
  - chat_logs = Session work documentation
  - change_log.md = Code change tracking
  - plan.md = Implementation progress

## ðŸ“‹ TODO LIST FOR WORKFLOW FIX

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. [ ] Document this critical issue in session3.md chat log
2. [ ] Create comprehensive plan for memory.json refactor
3. [ ] Update plan.md with completed infrastructure tasks
4. [ ] Document all Session 3 changes in change_log.md
5. [ ] Refactor memory.json to be the "brain" not a log
6. [ ] Add workflow rules to memory.json itself
7. [ ] Create memory.json template for proper structure
8. [ ] Update agent instructions in memory.json
9. [ ] Add critical reminders for common issues
10. [ ] Test new workflow with session handoff

### Memory.json Refactor Requirements:
1. **REMOVE**: All implementation details
2. **REMOVE**: Task lists and completed items
3. **REMOVE**: Session-specific information
4. **ADD**: Workflow rules and reminders
5. **ADD**: Critical file purposes
6. **ADD**: Common pitfalls to avoid
7. **ADD**: Agent coordination rules
8. **ADD**: Documentation standards
9. **ADD**: Session start checklist
10. **KEEP**: Architecture and tech stack info

### Correct File Purposes (MUST BE IN MEMORY):
- **memory.json**: Central brain - rules, reminders, workflow
- **chat_logs/**: Detailed session work documentation
- **change_log.md**: All code edits/deletions with rollback info
- **plan.md**: Living implementation progress tracker
- **updates/**: Implementation blueprints and plans
- **.claude/agents/**: Agent-specific instructions

### Critical Reminders for Memory.json:
1. ALWAYS update plan.md when tasks complete
2. ALWAYS document changes in change_log.md
3. NEVER use memory.json as a task list
4. NEVER use memory.json as a chat log
5. ALWAYS check these files at session start:
   - Previous session's chat log
   - plan.md for current progress
   - memory.json for rules/reminders
   - change_log.md for recent changes

## Context Window Protection
This documentation is critical and must be preserved. If context window runs out:
1. This file contains the workflow fix requirements
2. Memory.json needs complete refactoring
3. All files need proper purpose enforcement
4. Next session MUST prioritize this fix
