# Session 6 #
### Important###
- All changes made in this session or sequential sessions should prioritize making the mobile design of the website beautiful while giving the best user experience.
   - Any changes made should be strictly for mobile design and formatting/layout only, please make sure to preserve the desktop layout and all other display sizes. This update is strictly for mobile only.

## Home Page ##

- Overall goal: Make this page beautiful on mobile displays without changing overall design and layout that exists on desktop display (only if needed to make the mobile design work much better)

- ROI calculator is finally formatted correctly in the side by side view but now look extremely cramped. What can we do to fix this?

- The "TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND CONTROL" section cards still need to be reformatted when it comes to their layout - They need to be reorganized into a 3x3 grid. When doing this please resize the font and make the icon centered at the top of each card. Do what you need to do to ensure they look good and are formatted correctly. 

- "WHY INDUSTRY LEADERS CHOOSE STRIVE" sections cards are still vertically formatted and stacked. Let's please resize them along with the font size and icon size to make sure that everything looks good in this section.
   - The paragraph text (3rd text section from the top) might need to made smaller by a little? It looks like it's competing with the text above it

- The "Lead the AI Revolution in Your Industry" section is great. I only want to change one minor thing: Remove the translucent circles from the sroll arrows, make the arrows the same orange used on the website, and move the arrows to the outside of the cards for easier visibility.
