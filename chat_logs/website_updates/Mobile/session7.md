## Solutions Page ##

- Overall goal: Make this page beautiful on mobile displays without changing overall design and layout that exists on desktop display (only if needed to make the mobile design work much better)

- Please make the subheading text the same gray color (#94a3b8) that's used for the subheading text on the home page 

- Please reformat all cards on this page to be horizontally displayed instead of the 3x3 grid that we have now.
   - Make the description short to account for this reformating 
   - Make other necessary adjustments to the card format and layout that makes this new horizontal and full width card display visually appealing and look professional.
