# Session 9 #
### Important###
- All changes made in this session or sequential sessions should prioritize making the mobile design of the website beautiful while giving the best user experience.
   - Any changes made should be strictly for mobile design and formatting/layout only, please make sure to preserve the desktop layout and all other display sizes. This update is strictly for mobile only

## Company Page ##

- Overall goal: Make this page beautiful on mobile displays without changing overall design and layout that exists on desktop display (only if needed to make the mobile design work much better)

- Hero section looks good (company timeline). No changes required

- Please make the subheading text the same gray color (#94a3b8) that's used for the subheading text on the home page 

- Metrics / stats section is still vertically stacked and needs to be resized completely to fit in single line horizontally (change font size for numbers and words for this happen)
   - "Can't list names on website due to NDAs" Text is white so it blends in with the background and can barely be seen.

- The cards/badges in the "Mission, Vision & Values" section are still vertically stacked which isn't what we're going for. Please reformat the cards to be a 1x2 stack (one card on top: "Our Values" and then the other two cards below it) - Delete the orange square on the cards and add a relevant icon (lucide) to what the card is about. You can resize the font or do whatever is needed to make this format work. 

- The Headshot cards in "Meet Your Transformation Partners" section need to be reformatted to match the same function and format as the cards in the "Lead the AI Revolution in Your Industry" section on the home page where the user can click and swipe through them (also put the 3 bubbles that are used in that section on the home page for this section)
