# Mobile Device UI & UX Update #

## Session 2 ##
- IMPORTANT NOTE: DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE MOBILE UI AND UX - No other display sizes or formats should be changed at any time during this session!

### Enitre Website ###

- The coming soon banner is currently on top of the Chatbot icon. Just move the chatbot icon up to make sure it's formatted correctly with the coming soon banner. 

-  Fix the footer format to where the Contact text section is beside the quick links text section instead of being vertically stacked

### Mobile Nav Bar / Section ###
- Add page specific icons (lucide) to make the nav section not look so bland - Make the colors the same orange color that's used for all other icons on the website
