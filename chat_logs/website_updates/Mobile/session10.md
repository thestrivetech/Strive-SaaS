# Session 10 #
### Important###
- All changes made in this session or sequential sessions should prioritize making the mobile design of the website beautiful while giving the best user experience.
   - Any changes made should be strictly for mobile design and formatting/layout only, please make sure to preserve the desktop layout and all other display sizes. This update is strictly for mobile only.


## Contact Page ##

- Overall goal: Make this page beautiful on mobile displays without changing overall design and layout that exists on desktop display (only if needed to make the mobile design work much better)

- Make sure all buttons and text within the buttons are resized when viewed on different screen types - Currently the Chat Live With AI Specialist text on the bottom button is too big and goes off of the area of the button (it gets worse depending on the mobile screen size, same goes for the download brochure button - on some mobile screen sizes all buttons look fine but for others the text is too long)

- Error message pops up when I try to submit contact form: "Failed to send message - Invalid form data" - See if this is for mobile only or if its persistent on all displays and happening for the whole website
