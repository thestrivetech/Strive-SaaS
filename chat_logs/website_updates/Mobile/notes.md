# User Notes #

## Enitre Website ## - Session 2

- The coming soon banner is currently on top of the Chatbot icon. Just move the chatbot icon up to make sure it's formatted correctly with the coming soon banner. 

-  Fix the footer format to where the Contact text section is beside the quick links text section instead of being vertically stacked

### Mobile Nav Bar / Section ###
- Add page specific icons (lucide) to make the nav section not look so bland - Make the colors the same orange color that's used for all other icons on the website

### Home Page ### - Session 2 - Phase 2
- Need to adjust the arrows inside of the demo preview to be more visible but not be in the way of demo preview videos (move the arrows to the bottom of the demo preview display, they should still be insdide of the display though)

- ROI calculator is still too big and requires the user to scroll in order to see the ROI results - Try to make both cards smaller so they can be side by side in a 2 column setup so they appear side-by-side

- The "AI SOLUTIONS TAILORED TO YOUR INDUSTRY'S BIGGEST CHALLENGES" section needs to be reformatted on mobile so the user doesn't have to scroll down to see the pain points and solutions. I'm thinking we turn this section into a dropdown filter section where the user selects a industry and then the badges/cards appear that already exist (pain point and solution badges) in a 2x2 grid so the user doesn't have to scroll in order to see anyything when they select a specific industry

# Session 3 #
### Home Page ###

- Put section Icons above the header text for all sections (example: the calculator icon in the ROI calculator section looks weird when its beside the text header)

- The cards/badges in the "TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND CONTROL" section look weird, they look elongated vertically and stretched out - Change the text size or make the formatting fit for mobile displays 
   - This issue also exists in the "WHY INDUSTRY LEADERS CHOOSE STRIVE" section - The cards/badges look elongated vertically

- The cards in the "Lead the AI Revolution in Your Industry" section still are stacked vertically instead of there being one card display area where the user can swipe through the different cards or click arrows on the sides to look through the different cards that are in that section


# Session 3 - Phase 2 #
### Solution, Portfolio, and Resources Pages ###

- Please change the cards layout for all of these pages because the user is having to scroll vertically for a long time to get through all of the individual cards. Reformat the card layouts for mobile specifically so that way they can be in a 3x3 grid and still be read easily.

- Change the current filter system on the Portfolio and Resouce pages to be a dropdown filter system like the one on the Solutions page. The only two buttons that should exist on these two pages are "All" and "Filter" - The filter button text should change once the user selects an option in the filter. 
   - Make sure the samee highlight effect is used in this dropdown menu (copy the solutions page dropdown filter and the ROI calculator filter highlight effect)

# Session 4 #
### Company Page ###

- Roadmap to the future hero section needs to be reformatted completely to adjust to mobile display - Keep same design and functionality of the timeline but make sure that it's easier for the user to see the timeline. - Make sure that the user doesn't have to scroll for a long time - Make sure this setion remains the same design wise but is reformatted to fit mobile devices

- Make cards in the "OUR FOUNDATION" section smaller and reformat them to look better on mobile. 

- Change the metric section stats "150+ Successful Transformations" to "203 Total Projects Completed"

- Change the metric "8 Years Driving Operational Excellence" to "12 Fortune 500 Clients" - Context, put in fine print: "Cant list names on website due to NDAs" 

# Session 4 - Phase 2 #
### Contact Page ###

- Make sure this page remains the same design wise but is reformatted to fit and look good on mobile devices

### Request Page ###

- Make sure this page remains the same design wise but is reformatted to fit amobile devices

- Reformat the cards below the fillout form to all fit horizontally underneath the form instead of having to scroll to see all of them

- Make the calendly window formatted better please. Right now it looks elongated vertically (you can make the card on this screen extend to be the full width of the screen in order to make the calendly window wider and to make the formatting better)

# Session 5 #
### Assessment Meeting Page ###

- Make sure this page remains the same design wise but is reformatted to fit mobile devices

### Important###
- All changes made in this session or sequential sessions should prioritize making the mobile design of the website beautiful while giving the best user experience.
   - Any changes made should be strictly for mobile design and formatting/layout only, please make sure to preserve the desktop layout and all other display sizes. This update is strictly for mobile only.

## Home Page ##

- Overall goal: Make this page beautiful on mobile displays without changing overall design and layout that exists on desktop display (only if needed to make the mobile design work much better)

- ROI calculator is finally formatted correctly in the side by side view but now look extremely cramped. What can we do to fix this?

- The "TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND CONTROL" section cards still need to be reformatted when it comes to their layout - They need to be reorganized into a 3x3 grid. When doing this please resize the font and make the icon centered at the top of each card. Do what you need to do to ensure they look good and are formatted correctly. 

- "WHY INDUSTRY LEADERS CHOOSE STRIVE" sections cards are still vertically formatted and stacked. Let's please resize them along with the font size and icon size to make sure that everything looks good in this section.
   - The paragraph text (3rd text section from the top) might need to made smaller by a little? It looks like it's competing with the text above it

- The "Lead the AI Revolution in Your Industry" section is great. I only want to change one minor thing: Remove the translucent circles from the sroll arrows, make the arrows the same orange used on the website, and move the arrows to the outside of the cards for easier visibility.

# Session 7 #

## Solutions Page ##

- Overall goal: Make this page beautiful on mobile displays without changing overall design and layout that exists on desktop display (only if needed to make the mobile design work much better)

- Please make the subheading text the same gray color (#94a3b8) that's used for the subheading text on the home page 

- Please reformat all cards on this page to be horizontally displayed instead of the 3x3 grid that we have now.
   - Make the description short to account for this reformating 
   - Make other necessary adjustments to the card format and layout that makes this new horizontal and full width card display visually appealing and look professional. 


# Session 8 #

## Portfolio Page ##

- Overall goal: Make this page beautiful on mobile displays without changing overall design and layout that exists on desktop display (only if needed to make the mobile design work much better)

- Filter button shows two of the same icons when there should only be one.

- Please reformat all cards on this page to be horizontally displayed instead of the 3x3 grid that we have now.
   - Make the description short to account for this reformating 
   - Make other necessary adjustments to the card format and layout that makes this new horizontal and full width card display visually appealing and look professional. 

- Please make the subheading text the same gray color (#94a3b8) that's used for the subheading text on the home page 


## Resources Page ##
- Overall goal: Make this page beautiful on mobile displays without changing overall design and layout that exists on desktop display (only if needed to make the mobile design work much better)

- Filter button shows two of the same icons when there should only be one.

- All cards on the portfolio page are formatted terribly: Icons should be removed from each card, the buttons inside of each card are way too big (except for the view button) and the text inside of the buttons are way too big as well, the text in the View button is too big and going off of the button
   - The description text for each card is only a few words long so we need to fix this or make the descriptions smaller for mobile

- Please make the subheading text the same gray color (#94a3b8) that's used for the subheading text on the home page 


# Session 9 #

## Company Page ##

- Overall goal: Make this page beautiful on mobile displays without changing overall design and layout that exists on desktop display (only if needed to make the mobile design work much better)

- Hero section looks good (company timeline). No changes required

- Please make the subheading text the same gray color (#94a3b8) that's used for the subheading text on the home page 

- Metrics / stats section is still vertically stacked and needs to be resized completely to fit in single line horizontally (change font size for numbers and words for this happen)
   - "Can't list names on website due to NDAs" Text is white so it blends in with the background and can barely be seen.

- The cards/badges in the "Mission, Vision & Values" section are still vertically stacked which isn't what we're going for. Please reformat the cards to be a 1x2 stack (one card on top: "Our Values" and then the other two cards below it) - Delete the orange square on the cards and add a relevant icon (lucide) to what the card is about. You can resize the font or do whatever is needed to make this format work. 

- The Headshot cards in "Meet Your Transformation Partners" section need to be reformatted to match the same function and format as the cards in the "Lead the AI Revolution in Your Industry" section on the home page where the user can click and swipe through them (also put the 3 bubbles that are used in that section on the home page for this section)

# Session 10 #

## Contact Page ##

- Overall goal: Make this page beautiful on mobile displays without changing overall design and layout that exists on desktop display (only if needed to make the mobile design work much better)

- Make sure all buttons and text within the buttons are resized when viewed on different screen types - Currently the Chat Live With AI Specialist text on the bottom button is too big and goes off of the area of the button (it gets worse depending on the mobile screen size, same goes for the download brochure button - on some mobile screen sizes all buttons look fine but for others the text is too long)

- Error message pops up when I try to submit contact form: "Failed to send message - Invalid form data" - See if this is for mobile only or if its persistent on all displays and happening for the whole website
