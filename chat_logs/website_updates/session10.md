✅ **COMPLETED** - Add quick actions card on the Contact page to be a option and feature in Sai chatbox for users. - We need to change the quick action options for when it's in the chat window - The only one that needs to be changed is the "Customer Support" button - Replace this with "Request Demo" and then also add a "Get Custom Solution" button and a "Contact Us" button
