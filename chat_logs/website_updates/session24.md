## Portfolio Page ## 

- The text in the hero section doesn't really have anything to do with the page being a portfolio... Is this ok?

- Change button wording on each card to be specific to the type of content (View Prototype, View Template, etc)

## Sai / AI Assistance Chat Page ##

- Please put the "Coming Soon" banner below the following text header: "Your AI-Powered Business Solutions Assistant - Available 24/7" - Make sure this banner uses the same exact design as the other Orange "Coming Soon" banners.


### Other sctions of website ###

- We also need to make sure that all of the solutions found for specific industries in the ROI calculator are on the solutions page (all industry specific solutions should be mentioned on the Industry pop out cards and then also placed in their respective solution type pop out cards as well)
