# Session 22 # (prompted one at a time after claudes project analysis)

-Site wide-
- Make sure that the "Coming Soon" banner below Sai's chat icon remains visible even after the chat icon is clicked and the chat box opens

- The ROI calculator still isn't fixed with the time saving issue - The HIPPA Compliance solution makes the time savings amount go down along with the ROI numbers... This is happening for multiple solutions when selected - Remake the entire algorithm to make sure that all calculations are representing the correct calculations for each solution for each specific industry

- Add scroll feature into the ROI calculator for when users are selection a industry - Also need to add the search ability (look at the solutions page filter to make sure that this dropdown filter for the ROI calculator works the exact same, the ordering of the industries should also match that pages dropdown filter as well)

- We also need to make sure that all of the solutions found for specific industries in the ROI calculator are on the solutions page (all industry specific solutions should be mentioned on the Industry pop out cards and then also placed in their respective solution type pop out cards as well)

## Portfolio Page ##

- The text in the hero section doesn't really have anything to do with the page being a portfolio... Is this ok?

- Change button wording on each card to be specific to the type of content (View Prototype, View Template, etc)
