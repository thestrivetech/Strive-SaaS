## Important Session Notes for Next Session

### Context for Continuation:
1. **Progress Bar Issue on Demo Page**: The progress indicator alignment was fixed multiple times. The final working version uses a simple flex layout with labels properly aligned under step circles.

2. **Input Field Colors**: 
   - Get Started Step 3: White background inputs with orange borders
   - Contact Page: Dark blue background inputs with orange borders
   - Demo Page: Standard inputs with orange labels

3. **Navigation Fix**: "About Us" was renamed to "Company" but required two fixes as one instance was missed initially

4. **Breaking Issue Resolved**: React.Fragment syntax caused website to break temporarily - was fixed by reverting to simpler div structure

### Bugs/Issues to Watch:
- Progress indicator on demo page may need fine-tuning for mobile responsiveness
- Dropdown functionality for "Company" menu item not yet implemented (if needed)

## Next Steps
Continue with remaining 13 high-priority tasks, starting with:
1. Fix 'Schedule a Demo' button routing to /get-started
2. Fix Solutions page filter dropdown display and functionality
3. Add filter instruction text on Solutions page
