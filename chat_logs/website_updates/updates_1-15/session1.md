#### Changes Made:
- **Increased demo container sizes**:
  ```tsx
  // Before: max-w-sm sm:max-w-md lg:max-w-lg xl:max-w-xl 2xl:max-w-2xl
  // After: max-w-md sm:max-w-lg lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-2xl 2xl:max-w-3xl
  ```

  // After: gap-8 lg:gap-20 xl:gap-28 2xl:gap-32
  ```

### 2. Connect With Us Section Revamp 
**File**: `/client/src/pages/home.tsx` (lines 445-560)

#### Company-Focused Card Updates:
| Original Title | New Title | Focus Change |
|----------------|-----------|--------------|
| Enterprise Security | Partnership Security & Trust | Emphasizes trust relationship |
| Smart Automation | Collaborative Innovation | Highlights co-creation |
| Real-time Insights | Transparent Project Updates | Focus on communication |

### 3. Discord Icon Addition 
**File**: `/client/src/components/layout/footer.tsx`

#### Implementation:
- Created custom Discord SVG component (Discord icon not available in lucide-react)
- Added to social links section with proper styling
- Link: `https://discord.gg/q3djnrvP29`
- Opens in new tab with security attributes (`target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`)

```tsx
const DiscordIcon = ({ className }: { className?: string }) => (
  <svg
    className={className}
    viewBox="0 0 24 24"
    fill="currentColor"
    xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
  >
    {/* Discord path data */}
  </svg>
);
```

### 4. Integrated Business Platform Section Update 
**File**: `/client/src/pages/home.tsx` (lines 256-362)

#### Major Changes:
- **Title Update**: 
  - From: "INTEGRATED BUSINESS PLATFORM"
  - To: "YOUR PROJECT DASHBOARD"

- **New Heading**: 
  - "Stay Connected with Real-Time Project Insights & Daily Progress Updates"

- **Added Description**:
  - "Our exclusive client portal gives you complete visibility into your project's progress with daily snapshots, visual updates, milestone tracking, and direct communication with your dedicated team - all in one secure platform."

- **Modal System Implementation**:
  - Imported Dialog components from shadcn/ui
  - Replaced SolutionCard components with interactive Dialog triggers
  - Each card now opens a detailed modal with:
    - Key Features section
    - Benefits section
    - Call-to-action buttons (Request Demo, Learn More)

### 5. Why Choose Strive Section Enhancement 
**File**: `/client/src/pages/home.tsx` (lines 365-486)

#### Styling Updates:
- **Primary Heading Change**:
  ```tsx
  // "WHY CHOOSE STRIVE" is now the main heading with gradient
  <h2 className="text-3xl sm:text-4xl md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl font-bold">
    <span className="gradient-text">WHY CHOOSE STRIVE</span>
  </h2>
  ```

- **Secondary Subtitle**:
  ```tsx
  // "The Future of Business Starts Here" is now secondary
  <div className="text-xl sm:text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-white/90">
    The Future of Business Starts Here
  </div>
  ```

- **Button Updates**:
  - Text: "View Success Stories" � "Meet the Team"
  - Style: Added orange outline to match hero section
  - Navigation: `/portfolio` � `/about`
  - Class: `border-2 border-primary text-primary hover:bg-primary`

## Technical Considerations

### Responsive Design
- All changes maintain mobile-first approach
- Breakpoints properly configured (sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl)
- Touch-friendly interactive elements

### Performance
- Modal system uses lazy rendering (only renders when opened)
- No additional bundle size impact from Discord icon (inline SVG)
- Maintains existing lazy loading patterns

### Accessibility
- All interactive elements have proper test-ids
- Modal dialogs are keyboard accessible
- Social links have proper ARIA labels
- New tab links include security attributes

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Hero section demo preview displays correctly on large screens
- [ ] Arrow buttons are visible and properly styled
- [ ] Connect With Us cards show updated content
- [ ] Discord icon appears in footer and links correctly
- [ ] Solution cards open modals with details
- [ ] Why Choose Strive section has proper hierarchy
- [ ] Meet the Team button routes to /about page
- [ ] All changes responsive on mobile devices

## Files Modified Summary
1. `/client/src/components/ui/hero-section.tsx` - Demo preview and arrow fixes
2. `/client/src/pages/home.tsx` - Multiple section updates (Connect With Us, Platform, Why Choose)
3. `/client/src/components/layout/footer.tsx` - Discord icon addition

## Next Steps
- Run comprehensive testing on different screen sizes
- Verify all modal interactions work correctly
- Check accessibility with screen readers
- Consider adding animation transitions for modals
- Test Discord link connectivity

## Session Notes
- Used Serena MCP for intelligent code analysis
- All changes follow existing design patterns and conventions
- Maintained TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Preserved existing test-ids for automated testing
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Additional Update (Post-Session)
### "Watch Demo" to "View Demos" Button Text Change ✅
**File**: `/client/src/pages/home.tsx` (line 155)

#### Implementation:
- Added explicit `secondaryButtonText="View Demos"` prop to HeroSection component
- The button now correctly displays "View Demos" instead of the default "Watch Demo"
- This maintains consistency with the portfolio section where demos are displayed

```tsx
<HeroSection
  title="Custom AI Solutions Built for Real World Performance"
  subtitle="Unlock the power of artificial intelligence..."
  primaryButtonText="Get Started"
  secondaryButtonText="View Demos"  // Changed from default "Watch Demo"
  onPrimaryClick={handleGetStarted}
  onSecondaryClick={handleWatchDemo}
/>
```

## Serena MCP Optimization (Token Reduction)

### Problem
- Serena MCP consuming 10k+ tokens for simple tasks
- Large memory files (code_style_conventions.md = 224 lines/6KB)
- Redundant memory reading on each operation

### Implemented Optimizations

#### 1. **Memory Restructuring**
Created smaller, focused memory files:
- `quick_reference.md` (20 lines) - Essential info only
- `typescript_conventions.md` (16 lines) - TypeScript specific
- `react_patterns.md` (15 lines) - React patterns
- `backend_conventions.md` (16 lines) - Backend patterns
- `styling_guide.md` (17 lines) - Styling rules
- `file_locations.md` (21 lines) - Quick file paths
- `memory_index.md` - Directory of all memories

#### 2. **Configuration Optimizations**
Updated `.serena/project.yml`:
- Added ignored paths (node_modules, dist, build, etc.)
- Excluded rarely used tools (8 tools removed)
- Added initial prompt directing to use quick_reference first

#### 3. **Infrastructure**
- Created `.serena/cache/` directory for future caching
- Updated `.serena/.gitignore` with cache and temp files
- Backed up original memories to `.serena/memories.backup/`

### Results
- **Expected 70-80% token reduction** for simple tasks
- **Faster response times** with smaller file reads
- **Better organization** with focused memory files
- Original memories preserved for complex tasks

### Usage Guidelines
1. Start with `quick_reference` memory for most tasks
2. Use `memory_index` to find specific memories
3. Access original large memories only when needed
4. Use standard Edit/Read tools instead of Serena for simple edits
