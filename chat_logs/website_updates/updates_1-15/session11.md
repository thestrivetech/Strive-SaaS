# Solutions Page - SESSION 11 COMPLETED #

## Initial Task List:
1. Fix button links that were backwards - Get Custom Solution should go to Get Started page
2. Consider removing Solution Type filter or keeping both filters  
3. Add "All Industries" and "All Solutions" options to dropdown menus
4. Restructure page content to focus on pain points followed by solutions
5. Change card colors to white to match other pages

## ✅ Completed Tasks:
