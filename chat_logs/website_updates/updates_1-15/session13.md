# Contact Page Updates - Session 13

## Original Task List:

- Please copy the card text box color scheme and style on the step 3 "Get Started" page - Do this for the Login and Sign up text boxes as well
- Change text color that's above each text box to orange
- Change "Get in touch" to "Let's Connect" and make the word "Connect" the same gradient color that is used for other words in hero sections across the site

- Update the Schedule Consultation page to get more information from the user in regard to their business and what their business does
- Need to fix "Schedule a Demo" button, it doesn't go to any page. Make it go to the "Get started page" - Unless we want a different page specifically for demo requests
- Change Business Hours 8am to 8pm est
- "Schedule a Consultation" take out the "a" in this buttons text
- Make "Schedule a Consultation" have the same shiny hover effect as the "Get Started" button on the home page hero section

- Give all other buttons the same hover effects to the corresponding color scheme as the other buttons on the website
