### Company Page Updates (client/src/pages/company.tsx)

#### 1. Hero Section Replacement
- **Removed**: Original hero section with AI-themed animated background and Users icon
- **Moved**: "OUR VISION" and "Roadmap to the Future" timeline section from middle of page to become new hero
- **Maintained**: All gradient backgrounds, timeline animations, and visual effects
- **Result**: Company page now opens with the vision roadmap as the primary focus

#### 2. "View Our Work" Button Styling Updates (2 iterations)
- **First Update**: Changed from white border to orange (#ff7033) border with custom hover effects
- **Second Update**: Standardized to match exact styling pattern used across all hero sections:
  - Added `hero-gradient` background class
  - Changed hover color from `hover:text-white` to `hover:text-[#ff7033]`
  - Updated padding from `py-3` to `py-4`
  - Added `rounded-xl` for consistent border radius
  - Removed custom gradient shimmer effect for standardization
  - Final class: `hero-gradient border-2 border-[#ff7033] text-white hover:text-[#ff7033] px-8 py-4 text-lg font-semibold rounded-xl transition-all duration-300 hover:scale-105 shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl`

#### 3. "Start Your Journey" Button Enhancement
- **Added**: Complete shiny shimmer effect to match all other primary buttons
- **Enhanced styling**: 
  - `hover:shadow-xl` - Enhanced shadow on hover
  - `transition-all duration-300` - Smooth transitions
  - `hover:scale-105` - Subtle scale effect
  - `relative overflow-hidden group` - Container for shimmer
  - `before:absolute before:inset-0 before:bg-gradient-to-r before:from-transparent before:via-white/15 before:to-transparent before:-translate-x-full hover:before:translate-x-full before:transition-transform before:duration-500` - Shimmer animation

#### 4. Foundation Section Fix
- **Fixed**: Background color from undefined `bg-off-white` to `bg-white` in Mission, Vision & Values cards
- **Fixed**: Same issue in Team section member cards
- **Result**: Proper white background rendering across all card components

### Contact Page Updates (client/src/pages/contact.tsx)

#### 1. Form Field Reorganization
- **Moved**: "Company Name" field from before phone number to after phone number
- **Moved**: "Company Size" dropdown to directly below Company Name field
- **Maintained**: All styling, validation, and accessibility features
- **New Order**: First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone Number, Company Name, Company Size, Message

#### 2. Company Name Field Made Optional
- **Removed**: `required` attribute from Company Name input
- **Updated**: Label from "Company Name *" to "Company Name" (removed asterisk)
- **Result**: Users can now submit form without providing company name

#### 3. Brochure Button "Coming Soon" Badge (3 iterations)
- **Added**: ComingSoonBadge component to "Download Solutions Brochure" button
