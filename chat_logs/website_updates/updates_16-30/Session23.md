## Issues Resolved

### 1. Hardcoded Source URL Bug

- **Solution:** Changed to `href={solution.sourceUrl}`

### 2. Browser Caching Issues
- **Problem:** Changes weren't reflecting due to stale build artifacts
- **Solution:** Cleared `dist/` directory and rebuilt with `npm run build`

### 3. Dead Link - HIPAA Violation Article
- **Original:** hipaajournal.com article (dead link)
- **Replaced With:** HHS.gov official enforcement data
- **New Statistic:** "$144M in total HIPAA penalties to date"

## Tasks Remaining for Next Session

### Source Link Validation Needed
