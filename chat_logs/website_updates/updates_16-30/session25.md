# Resources Page # - Session 25

## Initial Tasks Requested:
- The bottom of the G in "Intelligence" is slightly hidden in the hero section
- Please make the filter buttons the same color scheme and hover color effect as the portfolio pages filter buttons
- The wording on the two buttons in the hero section isn't very clear. Please add "Let's Learn" as the button that takes the user lower onto the page to look further into our available resources. The other button should stay the same.
- Remove the download button from popouts
- Remove "Consulting" from the button and replace it with "Get Expert Insight"
  - Make sure after deleting the "download" button that the popout cards look good visually when it comes to the layout and format
- Completely update the quiz pop out cards - The current word color on the pop out card blends in with the dark blue card background so just make it the same blue color that's used for the brain icon on the pop out cards

## Initial Resources Page Updates Completed:

## Additional Session Updates:

### 14. Button Arrangement Corrections ✅
