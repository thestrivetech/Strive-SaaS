## Phase 3: Request Page Enhancement

### User Request for Additional Features
- Add project timeline selection on step 2 (move budget below it)
- Add Company Name field on step 1 (move job title below it) [SKIPPED per user request]
- Add hover effect to "Return to Homepage" button
- Update success message wording

### 1. **Project Timeline Implementation**
**Changes Made:**
- Added `projectTimeline: ""` to form state
- Created `projectTimelines` array with options:
  - "Immediate (ASAP)"
  - "Within 1 month"
  - "1-3 months"
  - "3-6 months"
  - "6-12 months"
  - "12+ months"
  - "Just exploring"
- Repositioned fields in Step 2: Project Timeline → Budget Range

### 2. **UI Enhancement - Button Hover Effect**
**Changes Made:**
- Enhanced "Return to Homepage" button with: `hover:scale-105 hover:shadow-xl transition-all duration-300`
- Added smooth scale and shadow animations on hover

### 3. **Success Message Update**
**Original Message:**
> "Thank you for your interest in Strive. Our team will review your requirements and contact you within 24 hours to schedule your personalized showcase."

**Updated Message:**
> "Thank you for your interest in Strive. You will receive a confirmation email momentarily. Our team will review your requirements and requests to have your showcase ready at the requested showcase time!"

## Phase 4: Critical Bug Fix

### Issue Discovered
User reported that clicking "Next" button on step 2 after visiting step 3 would submit the entire form instead of advancing to step 3.

### Root Cause Analysis
The entire multi-step form was wrapped in `<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>`, causing any form submission event to trigger the submit handler regardless of current step.

### Solution Implemented
**Modified `handleSubmit` function:**
```typescript
const handleSubmit = (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  
  // Only submit if we're on step 3, otherwise do nothing
  if (formStep !== 3) {
    return;
  }
  
  // ... rest of submission logic
};
```

**Result:** Form now only processes submission when user is actually on step 3, preventing accidental submissions during navigation.

## Phase 5: Code Analysis & Optimization

### Comprehensive Code Review
Analyzed the entire Request page codebase for redundant, unused, or optimizable code.

### Issues Identified:

#### 1. **Unused Imports (7 total)**
- `Building2` - Never referenced in component
- `Mail` - Not used (email field exists but no icon displayed)
- `Phone` - Not used (phone field exists but no icon displayed)
- `User` - Not used (user fields exist but no icons displayed)
- `Briefcase` - Never referenced
- `Sparkles` - Never referenced
- `Badge` - Component imported but never used

#### 2. **Formatting Issues**
- Empty lines at lines 187-189 in return statement
- Typo on line 448: "Demo23 Focus Areas" instead of "Solution Focus Areas"
- Unused CSS class `demo-cursor-click` from old demo page

#### 3. **Code Duplication**
- Inline style object `{ backgroundColor: '#ffffff', color: '#020a1c', borderColor: '#ff7033' }` repeated 12+ times throughout form fields

### Future Considerations
- Verified that unused icons (`Mail`, `Phone`, `User`) could be safely removed
- Confirmed they can be easily re-imported if needed for future Supabase database integration
- Preserved Calendly integration code as requested for upcoming API implementation

## Phase 6: Code Cleanup Implementation

### 1. **Unused Import Removal**
**Removed:**
```typescript
// Before
import { 
  Building2, Users, Target, Calendar, Clock, Mail, Phone, User, 
  Briefcase, CheckCircle, ChevronRight, Sparkles, Zap
} from "lucide-react";
import { Badge } from "@/components/ui/badge";

// After  
import { 
  Users, Target, Calendar, Clock, CheckCircle, ChevronRight, Zap
} from "lucide-react";
// Badge import completely removed
```

### 2. **Typo and Formatting Fixes**
- Fixed: "Demo23 Focus Areas" → "Solution Focus Areas" 
- Removed unnecessary empty lines in return statement
- Removed unused CSS class `demo-cursor-click` from submit button

### 3. **Style Extraction and Optimization**
**Before:** 12+ instances of repeated inline style
**After:** Single constant definition
```typescript
// Added constant
const inputStyle = { 
  backgroundColor: '#ffffff', 
  color: '#020a1c', 
  borderColor: '#ff7033' 
};

// All instances now use: style={inputStyle}
```

**Impact:** Improved maintainability, reduced code duplication, easier future style changes

## Phase 8: Calendly Integration Implementation

### **User Request for Calendar Integration**
After the website restructuring and UI enhancements, the user requested to replace the Calendly placeholder sections with actual working Calendly calendar embeds using their company URL: `calendly.com/strivetech`.

### **Initial Issue Discovery**
The Calendly iframes were being blocked by the browser with "Content blocked" errors due to strict Content Security Policy (CSP) configuration in the server middleware.

### 1. **Root Cause Analysis**
**Files Analyzed:** `/server/middleware/security.ts`

**Issue Identified:**
- CSP setting `frameSrc: ["'none'"]` was blocking ALL iframes, including Calendly
- Missing Calendly domains in `scriptSrc` and `connectSrc` directives
- Server-side security middleware preventing iframe embedding

### 2. **Calendly Iframe Implementation**
**Files Modified:** 
- `/client/src/pages/request.tsx`
- `/client/src/pages/consultation.tsx`

**Request Page Changes:**
```jsx
// Replaced placeholder div with actual Calendly iframe
<div className="w-full rounded-lg overflow-hidden" style={{ border: '1px solid #e5e7eb' }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://calendly.com/strivetech"
    width="100%"
    height="630"
    frameBorder="0"
    title="Schedule Your Showcase - Strive Tech"
    style={{ borderRadius: '8px' }}
  />
</div>
```

**Consultation Page Changes:**
```jsx
// Replaced placeholder div with actual Calendly iframe
<div className="w-full rounded-lg overflow-hidden" style={{ border: '1px solid #e5e7eb' }}>
