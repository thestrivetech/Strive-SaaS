âœ… **COMPLETED** - Have error message pop up if the email isn't an actual email and the same goes for the phone number
- **Implementation Details:**

  - **Email Validation:**
    - Regex pattern: `/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/`
    - Real-time validation on input change

    - Error message: "Please enter a valid email address"

    - Supports international formats and common formatting
    - Real-time validation on input change
    - Red border styling for invalid fields  
    - Error message: "Please enter a valid phone number"
  - **Form Submission Prevention:**
    - Updated isContactValid() function to include validation checks

    - Submit button remains disabled until all validation passes
  - **Added validation state management:**
    - New state: `validationErrors` with email and phone fields
    - Dynamic border colors based on validation status
    - Error messages appear below respective fields

âœ… **COMPLETED** - Fix the word "Advantage" - the bottom of the G is currently behind part of the hero section color somehow
- **Implementation Details:**
  - **Root Cause:** `pb-2` class was adding bottom padding that caused text clipping
  - **Solution:** Removed `pb-2` class from "AI Advantage" span element
  - **Location:** Line 392 in assessment.tsx
  - **Result:** Text now renders properly without any cutoff issues

âœ… **COMPLETED** - Change the home page hero section button, "Book Free Assessment" to be linked to the assessment page

  - **Navigation Flow:** Home page â†’ Assessment page (correct flow for booking)
  - **Impact:** Users clicking "Book Free Assessment" now properly reach the assessment form

âœ… **ALREADY IMPLEMENTED** - Need to allow the user to click "Other" when they're selecting their "Current Challenges" - This should then let them type in their own answer
- **Verification Details:**
  - Functionality was already correctly implemented in assessment.tsx
  - **"Other" Checkbox Logic:** Lines 241-250 show conditional input field
  - **State Management:** `otherChallenge` field in contactData state
  - **UI Behavior:** Text input appears when "Other" checkbox is selected
  - **Data Handling:** Custom challenge text is properly stored and managed
  - **No changes needed** - existing implementation is working correctly

- **Implementation Details:**
  - **Location:** Request page, Step 3 form, Submit Request button (lines 575-579)
  - **Issue:** Button had 3 lightning bolt (Zap) icons causing visual clutter
  - **Original Configuration:**
    - One before "Submit Request" (h-5 w-5)
    - One after "Submit Request" (h-5 w-5) 
    - One extra smaller one at the end (h-4 w-4)
