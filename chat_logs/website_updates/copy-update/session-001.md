## Session Update: Terminology & File Name Changes
**Updated**: January 9, 2025

### Post-Session Critical Updates

Following the initial StoryBrand copy transformation, critical terminology and file naming updates were implemented to ensure consistency across the website.

## 1. CONSULTATION â†’ ASSESSMENT CHANGES

### Rationale for Change:
- "Assessment" better aligns with professional B2B services
- Creates stronger value perception (assessment = analysis/evaluation)
- Maintains consistency with the assessment page naming
- Reduces confusion between different service touchpoints

### Changes Implemented:

#### Homepage (home.tsx)
**Line 162 - Hero Section CTA:**
- **Before**: `secondaryButtonText="Book Free Consultation"`
- **After**: `secondaryButtonText="Book Free Assessment"`
- **Context**: Secondary call-to-action button in hero section
- **Reasoning**: Aligns with the assessment page and creates consistent user journey

**Line 545 - Get Started Section:**
- **Before**: `Book Your Free Consultation â†’ Receive Your Custom AI Solution Roadmap...`
- **After**: `Book Your Free Assessment â†’ Receive Your Custom AI Solution Roadmap...`
- **Context**: Three-step process description
- **Reasoning**: Maintains process flow clarity while using consistent terminology

#### Contact Page (contact.tsx)
**Line 345 - Quick Actions Description:**
- **Before**: `Book your free strategy consultation and explore our resources`
- **After**: `Book your free strategy assessment and explore our resources`
- **Context**: Description text for quick actions section
- **Reasoning**: "Strategy assessment" sounds more analytical and value-driven

**Line 357 - Primary Quick Action Button:**
- **Before**: `Book Free Strategy Consultation`
- **After**: `Book Free Strategy Assessment`
- **Context**: Main CTA button in quick actions card
- **Reasoning**: Consistent with overall terminology change

#### Assessment Page (assessment.tsx)
**Line 395 - Page Subtitle:**
- **Before**: `book your complimentary 30-minute consultation today`
- **After**: `book your complimentary 30-minute assessment today`
- **Context**: Main subtitle describing the service
- **Reasoning**: Page is already named "assessment" - ensures internal consistency

## 2. ABOUT â†’ COMPANY RENAMING

### Rationale for Change:
- "Company" is more direct and professional for B2B audiences
- Reduces ambiguity (About what? vs. Company = clear)
- Aligns with modern B2B website conventions
- Creates clearer navigation structure

### Changes Implemented:

#### File System Changes:
**File Rename:**
- **Before**: `/client/src/pages/about.tsx`
- **After**: `/client/src/pages/company.tsx`
- **Impact**: Physical file renamed to match new naming convention

#### Component Updates (company.tsx):
**Line 8 - Component Declaration:**
- **Before**: `const About = () => {`
- **After**: `const Company = () => {`
- **Reasoning**: Component name must match file name for consistency

**Line 447 - Export Statement:**
- **Before**: `export default About;`
- **After**: `export default Company;`
- **Reasoning**: Export must reference updated component name

#### Import Updates (App.tsx):
**Line 24 - Lazy Import:**
- **Before**: `const About = lazy(() => import("@/pages/about"));`
- **After**: `const Company = lazy(() => import("@/pages/company"));`
- **Reasoning**: Import path and variable name updated to match new file

**Line 65 - Route Component:**
- **Before**: `<Route path="/about" component={About} />`
- **After**: `<Route path="/about" component={Company} />`
- **Note**: Path kept as "/about" for URL consistency and SEO preservation
- **Reasoning**: Maintains existing links while using new component

#### Text Updates:
**Footer (footer.tsx) Line 125:**
- **Before**: `About Us`
- **After**: `Company`
- **Context**: Footer navigation link text
- **Reasoning**: Cleaner, more professional navigation label

**Contact Page (contact.tsx) Line 453:**
- **Before**: `About Strive`
- **After**: `Company Overview`
- **Context**: Section header in brochure modal
- **Reasoning**: More descriptive and professional heading

## 3. IMPACT ANALYSIS

- URL paths maintained (/about) to preserve SEO value
