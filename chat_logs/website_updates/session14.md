## Additional Tasks Requested

User requested three additional changes:

2. **Update About page secondary button to match Solutions page styling**
3. **Change timeline from yearly to quarterly format starting Q4 2026**

## Session 14 Research Phase
### Portfolio Analysis
- Located portfolio components: `client/src/components/ui/portfolio-card.tsx` and `client/src/pages/portfolio.tsx`
- Found "View Code" button in Project Detail Modal section at lines 244-247
- Button structure: GitHub icon with link to `selectedProject.githubUrl`

### About Page vs Solutions Page Button Comparison
**About Page Secondary Button** (lines 149-157):
```jsx
<Button 
  size="lg" 
  variant="outline" 
  className="hero-gradient border-2 border-[#ff7033] text-white hover:text-[#ff7033] px-8 py-4 text-lg font-semibold rounded-xl transition-all duration-300 hover:scale-105 shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl"
  onClick={() => window.location.href = '/contact'}
  data-testid="button-join-team"
>
  Join Our Team
</Button>
```

**Solutions Page Secondary Button** (lines 345-353):
```jsx
<Button 
  size="lg" 
  variant="outline" 
  className="hero-gradient border-2 border-[#ff7033] text-white hover:text-[#ff7033] px-8 py-4 text-lg font-semibold rounded-xl transition-all duration-300 hover:scale-105 shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl"
  onClick={() => document.getElementById('solutions-grid')?.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' })}
  data-testid="button-explore-solutions"
>
  Explore Solutions
</Button>
```

**Finding**: Buttons already have identical styling - no changes needed.

### Timeline Analysis
**Current Format** (lines 66-92 in about.tsx):
```javascript
const visionMilestones = [
  {
    year: "2025",
    title: "AI Revolution Launch",
    description: "Launching next-gen AI automation platform with predictive analytics",
    icon: <CpuChipIcon className="h-6 w-6" />,
    status: "current"
  },
  {
    year: "2026",
    title: "Global Expansion", 
    description: "Expanding to 50+ countries with localized AI solutions",
    icon: <GlobeAltIcon className="h-6 w-6" />,
    status: "upcoming"
  },
  // ... more yearly entries
];
```

## Session 14 Implementation Phase

### Task 1: Remove "View Code" Button ✅
**File**: `/client/src/pages/portfolio.tsx`

```jsx
<Button variant="outline" onClick={() => window.open(selectedProject.githubUrl, '_blank')}>
  <Github className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
  View Code
</Button>
```
**Result**: Portfolio modal now shows only "View Demo" and "Get Started" buttons

### Task 2: About Page Button Styling ✅  
**File**: `/client/src/pages/about.tsx`  
**Action**: No changes needed - styling already matches Solutions page exactly  
**Result**: Both pages use identical button styling with `hero-gradient border-2 border-[#ff7033]` classes

### Task 3: Timeline Format Change ✅
**File**: `/client/src/pages/about.tsx`

**After**: Q4 2026, Q1 2027, Q2 2027, Q3 2027, Q4 2027 (quarterly)
