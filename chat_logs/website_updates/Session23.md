## Issues Resolved

### 1. Hardcoded Source URL Bug
- **Problem:** Source URL was hardcoded in JSX template instead of using `solution.sourceUrl`

- **Solution:** Changed to `href={solution.sourceUrl}`

### 2. Browser Caching Issues
- **Problem:** Changes weren't reflecting due to stale build artifacts
- **Solution:** Cleared `dist/` directory and rebuilt with `npm run build`

### 3. Dead Link - HIPAA Violation Article
- **Original:** hipaajournal.com article (dead link)
- **Replaced With:** HHS.gov official enforcement data
- **New Statistic:** "$144M in total HIPAA penalties to date"

## Tasks Remaining for Next Session

### Source Link Validation Needed
Several sources may need verification/updating:
1. Check all 32 source URLs are still active
2. Verify statistics are current (some from 2022-2023)
3. Consider updating older sources with 2024/2025 data

### Potential Dead Links to Check:
- Aberdeen downtime report
- Vanson Bourne industrial operations
- IHL Services retail inventory
- Scholastic teacher survey
- Some McKinsey/PWC/Deloitte reports may have moved

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. Run automated link checker on all 32 sourceUrls
2. Update any dead links with alternative sources
3. Consider adding fallback URLs or archive links
4. Update statistics to 2024/2025 where available
