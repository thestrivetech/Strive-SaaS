# Chat Log System Documentation

## Overview
This directory maintains comprehensive session logs and context for AI-assisted development. The system ensures continuity between sessions and tracks all project changes systematically.

## File Descriptions

### SESSION_TEMPLATE.md
A comprehensive template for logging each development session. Copy this template when starting a new session and fill in all relevant sections.

**Key Sections:**
- Session metadata (date, time, git info)
- Current project state and goals
- Work completed with detailed file changes
- Testing and validation results
- Challenges encountered and solutions
- TODO items and handoff notes
- Critical information for next session

### CHANGELOG.md
Tracks all changes made to the project across all sessions.

**Follows Standard Format:**
- Added - New features or files
- Changed - Modifications to existing functionality
- Fixed - Bug fixes
- Removed - Deleted files or deprecated features
- Security - Security-related changes
- Notes - Important context or decisions

### Memory System (.claude/memory.json)
Maintains persistent project knowledge:
- Project metadata and structure
- Tech stack details
- Architecture patterns
- Development workflow
- Current features and APIs
- Known issues and technical debt
- Session history
- Code conventions

## Workflow Guide

### Starting a New Session

1. **Check Previous Session**
   ```bash
   # Review last session log
   ls -la chat_logs/sessions/
   
   # Check current git status
   git status
   git log --oneline -5
   ```

2. **Create New Session Log**
   ```bash
   # Copy template
   cp chat_logs/SESSION_TEMPLATE.md chat_logs/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD_session_name.md
   
   # Fill in session metadata
   - Date and time
   - Previous session reference
   - Current git branch and commit
   ```

3. **Review Memory Context**
   ```bash
   # Check memory.json for project context
   cat .claude/memory.json | jq '.working_context'
   ```

4. **Set Session Goals**
   - Define primary objective
   - List secondary tasks
   - Note any blockers from previous session

### During the Session

1. **Log Changes As You Work**
   - Update session log with each significant change
   - Note file modifications with line numbers
   - Document any decisions made
   - Track problems encountered

2. **Update Changelog**
   - Add entries for significant changes
   - Group related changes together
   - Include context for why changes were made

3. **Maintain Memory.json**
   - Update current_focus
   - Add new patterns discovered
   - Update known_issues if any found
   - Record important decisions

### Ending a Session

1. **Complete Session Log**
   - Fill in all remaining sections
   - Add session end time
   - Document current application state
   - Write detailed handoff notes

2. **Update Memory Context**
   ```json
   {
     "working_context": {
       "last_session": "current_session_id",
       "last_activity": "YYYY-MM-DD",
       "current_focus": "what was worked on",
       "next_priorities": ["task1", "task2"],
       "uncommitted_changes": ["file1", "file2"]
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Final Checklist**
   - [ ] All tests passing?
   - [ ] Build successful?
   - [ ] Changes documented?
   - [ ] TODOs clearly marked?
   - [ ] Handoff notes complete?

4. **Archive If Needed**
   ```bash
   # Move completed sessions to archives
   mkdir -p chat_logs/archives/YYYY/MM
   mv chat_logs/sessions/old_session.md chat_logs/archives/YYYY/MM/
   ```

## Best Practices

### Documentation Standards

1. **Be Specific**
   - Include file paths and line numbers
   - Document exact commands run
   - Note specific error messages

2. **Be Comprehensive**
   - Log all significant changes
   - Document reasoning for decisions
   - Include alternative approaches considered

3. **Be Clear**
   - Use consistent formatting
   - Write for future context
   - Highlight critical information

### Context Preservation

1. **Always Document**
   - Why a change was made
   - What alternatives were considered
   - Any temporary workarounds
   - Future implications

2. **Link References**
   - Reference previous sessions
   - Link to relevant documentation
   - Note related issues or tickets

3. **Maintain Continuity**
   - Clear handoff notes
   - Explicit next steps
   - Current state description

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Start new session
./scripts/new_session.sh  # If script exists

# View recent sessions
ls -lt chat_logs/sessions/ | head -5

# Search session logs
grep -r "search_term" chat_logs/sessions/

# Check last changes
tail -20 chat_logs/CHANGELOG.md

# View current memory
cat .claude/memory.json | jq '.working_context'

# Archive old sessions
find chat_logs/sessions -mtime +30 -exec mv {} chat_logs/archives/ \;
```

## Session Naming Convention

```
YYYY-MM-DD_descriptor.md

Examples:
2025-09-02_initial_setup.md
2025-09-02_auth_implementation.md
2025-09-03_bug_fix_routing.md
```

## Integration with Git

### Commit Message Format
```
[Session: ID] Brief description

- Detailed change 1
- Detailed change 2

Session log: chat_logs/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD_*.md
```

### Branch Naming
```
session/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name
```

## Troubleshooting

### Lost Context?
1. Check last session in `chat_logs/sessions/`
2. Review `memory.json` working_context
3. Check git log for recent commits
4. Review CHANGELOG.md for recent changes

### Conflicting Information?
1. Session logs are source of truth for timeline
2. memory.json for current state
3. CHANGELOG.md for change history
4. Git commits for actual code changes

## Maintenance

### Weekly Tasks
- Archive completed sessions
- Update memory.json with patterns learned
- Consolidate TODOs from session logs

### Monthly Tasks
- Review and clean up archives
- Update documentation if patterns change
- Analyze recurring issues from logs

## Version History

- **v1.0.0** (2025-09-02): Initial chat log system implementation
  - Created comprehensive session template
  - Established memory.json schema
  - Implemented changelog structure
