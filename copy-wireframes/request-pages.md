Final StoryBrand Optimization Tips
Clarify the Problem up front: What pain are businesses experiencing that you solve better than anyone?
Position your company as the trusted guide with proven expertise.
Make the visitor the hero: Use “you/your business” language.
Lay out a simple 3-step plan so action feels easy.
Use concrete social proof: Add testimonials, awards, stats, or recognizable client logos if available.
Compelling CTA: Take the fear out (“Free demo,” “No obligation,” etc.)
