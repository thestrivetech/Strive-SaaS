Here's a detailed assessment and direct rewrite suggestions for your B2B AI Solutions company's consultation page, using the StoryBrand framework and B2B best practices to increase clarity and conversions:

What's good right now:
Clear headline: "Schedule Your Consultation" is direct and action-oriented.
Immediate benefit: "Let's discuss how AI can transform your business" speaks to outcomes.
Free consult: “Book a free 30-minute consultation” lowers barriers to entry.
Focus on user: The form asks about the user's business and needs.
Value props: Sections like “Expert Insights,” “Tailored Solutions,” and “Implementation Roadmap” highlight value.
What could be improved:
More customer-centric messaging—put the business needs and pain points of your ideal client front and center.
Clearer differentiation of your process/approach (StoryBrand recommends making your process obvious).
Tighter, more emotionally resonant language—less generic, more specific to buyer pains and outcomes.
Stronger calls-to-action both above and below the form.
The mission statement (“To empower businesses…”) could be sharpened and better connected to the prospect's story.
Use client language (problems, stakes, transformation) not just features—especially for B2B decision makers.

Additional Suggestions (StoryBrand + B2B):
Guide, Not Hero: Remind prospects THEY are the hero; position your team as the expert guide who helps them win.
Make It About the Buyer: Use “your” and “you” more often than “our” and “we.”
Address Stakes/Risks: Briefly mention what's at risk if the buyer doesn’t adapt to AI or modernize, then how you de-risk the process.
Add Success Stories/Logos: If possible, place 1-2 quick testimonials or client logos near the form to build trust.
Clarify Next Steps: After scheduling, what happens? Consider a short “what to expect” (e.g., “You’ll meet with an AI strategist who’ll outline…”).
Language: Replace generic phrases with specificity (“AI can transform your business” → “AI can save your team 30+ hours monthly and unlock new revenue streams”).
Industry Focus: If you specialize in sectors (e.g., finance, logistics), spell this out for B2B trust.
