ðŸš€ Deployment Checklist
Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (30 minutes)
bash# 1. Deploy database schema
psql "your-supabase-connection-string" < nurture-campaign-schema.sql

# 2. Verify tables created
psql "your-supabase-connection-string" -c "
  SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
  WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
  AND table_name LIKE '%campaign%';"

# 3. Set up SendGrid
# - Authenticate your domain
# - Create API key with Full Access
# - Note the API key (only shown once!)
Phase 2: N8n Configuration (30 minutes)
bash# 1. Create credentials in N8n
# - supabase_main (PostgreSQL)
# - sendgrid_api (SendGrid API)

# 2. Set environment variables
N8N_EMAIL_PROVIDER=sendgrid
N8N_SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.xxxxx
N8N_EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@yourcompany.com
N8N_EMAIL_FROM_NAME=Your Company
N8N_WEBHOOK_BASE_URL=https://your-n8n-instance.com
N8N_MAX_EMAILS_PER_MINUTE=100

# 3. Import all 6 workflows
# - Use N8n UI or API
# - Activate each workflow
# - Record webhook URLs
Phase 3: SendGrid Integration (15 minutes)
bash# 1. Configure Event Webhook in SendGrid
# URL: https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/email-events
# Events: Delivered, Opened, Clicked, Bounced, Spam Reports, Unsubscribes

# 2. Test webhook
# - Use SendGrid test button
# - Verify event appears in N8n Event Tracker workflow
Phase 4: Testing (45 minutes)
bash# 1. Create test data (use SQL from testing guide)
# 2. Run Test 1: End-to-End Flow
# 3. Verify email sent and received
# 4. Simulate open/click events
# 5. Check all database updates
Phase 5: Production Launch (15 minutes)
bash# 1. Create your first real campaign
# 2. Monitor for 24 hours
# 3. Run daily health check queries
# 4. Adjust based on performance
Total Deployment Time: ~2.5 hours

ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips
Campaign Strategy

Start Simple: Begin with 2-3 message sequence
Test Everything: A/B test subject lines, send times, content
Monitor Closely: Watch metrics daily for first 2 weeks
Iterate Fast: Adjust based on data, not assumptions

Content Best Practices

Subject Lines: Keep under 50 characters, avoid spam words
Personalization: Use at least 3 tokens per email
CTAs: Clear, action-oriented, above the fold
Mobile: 60%+ opens are mobile - optimize accordingly

Troubleshooting

Check Logs First: N8n execution history has most answers
Database is Truth: Query database to verify workflow actions
Test Webhooks: Use curl to test endpoints directly
Monitor SendGrid: Check their dashboard for deliverability issues
