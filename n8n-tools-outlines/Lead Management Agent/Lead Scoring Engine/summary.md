## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### 1. Deploy Database (5 minutes)

```sql
-- Copy SQL from "Lead Scoring Database Schemas" artifact
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
-- Verify: 6 tables created with RLS enabled
```

### 2. Configure N8n (10 minutes)

1. **Add Supabase Credential**
   - Settings ‚Üí Credentials ‚Üí New ‚Üí Supabase
   - Name: `supabase_main`
   - Host: Your Supabase URL
   - Key: Service Role Key

2. **Update All Workflows**
   - For each Supabase node in all 4 workflows
   - Select credential: `supabase_main`
   - Save

3. **Activate Workflows**
   - Toggle "Activate" on all 4 workflows
   - Verify webhook URLs are active

### 3. Test System (15 minutes)

```bash
# Test 1: Real-Time Scoring
curl -X POST https://jgramey.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/lead-scoring/event \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"organization_id":"YOUR_ORG","lead_id":"test-001","event_type":"email_open"}'

# Expected: {"success":true,"score":XX,"grade":"X"}

# Test 2: Stage Transition
curl -X POST https://jgramey.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/stage-transition \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"organization_id":"YOUR_ORG","lead_id":"test-001","old_stage":"cold","new_stage":"warm"}'

# Test 3: Conversion Tracking  
curl -X POST https://jgramey.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/conversion-tracking \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"organization_id":"YOUR_ORG","lead_id":"test-001","conversion_type":"appointment_booked"}'
```

## üí° How It Works

### Real-Time Scoring Flow

```
Event Occurs ‚Üí Webhook Triggered ‚Üí Score Calculated ‚Üí Database Updated ‚Üí 
‚Üí Stage Checked ‚Üí Transitions Handled ‚Üí Agent Notified (if hot lead)
```

### Scoring Algorithm (100 Points Total)

| Category | Points | Key Factors |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Demographics** | 25 | Contact info, location, lead type |
| **Qualification** | 35 | Budget, timeline, authority |
| **Engagement** | 25 | Email opens, recency, activity |
| **Behavioral** | 15 | Property views, meetings |
| **Adjustments** | ¬±15 | Bonus for high engagement, penalty for inactivity |

### Grade Thresholds

- **A (90-100)**: üî• Hot lead - contact within 24 hours
- **B (75-89)**: ‚≠ê Warm lead - prioritize outreach
- **C (60-74)**: üìä Moderate - nurture campaigns
- **D (45-59)**: ‚ùÑÔ∏è Cold - long-term nurturing
- **F (0-44)**: üí§ Very cold - minimal resources

## üîó Integration Points

### From Lead Capture System

When a lead is captured, trigger initial scoring:

```javascript
await fetch('https://jgramey.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/lead-scoring/event', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    organization_id: lead.org_id,
    lead_id: lead.id,
    event_type: 'form_submit'
  })
});
```

### From Email Marketing System

When lead opens email:

```javascript
on('email.opened', async (event) => {
  await fetch('https://jgramey.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/lead-scoring/event', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      organization_id: event.org_id,
      lead_id: event.lead_id,
      event_type: 'email_open',
      event_data: { campaign_id: event.campaign_id }
    })
  });
});
```

### From CRM System

When lead converts:

```javascript
on('deal.won', async (event) => {
  await fetch('https://jgramey.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/conversion-tracking', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      organization_id: event.org_id,
      lead_id: event.lead_id,
      conversion_type: 'contract_signed',
      conversion_value: event.deal_value
    })
  });
});
```
