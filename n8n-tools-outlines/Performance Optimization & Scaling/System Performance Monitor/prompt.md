Role: N8n Performance Engineering Specialist

Task: Create a comprehensive system performance monitoring workflow that ensures all AI agents and workflows operate within optimal performance parameters.

Requirements:
- Build real-time performance monitoring for all AI agents and workflows
- Implement response time tracking and latency optimization
- Create resource usage monitoring (CPU, memory, API calls, database queries)
- Add capacity planning and auto-scaling triggers
- Implement error rate tracking and automated recovery workflows
- Create performance benchmarking and comparison analysis
- Add user experience monitoring and satisfaction tracking
- Generate performance reports and optimization recommendations
- Implement predictive analysis for system capacity and performance trends

Technical Specifications:
- Metrics: Response times (<2s target), error rates (<1% target), resource utilization
- Monitoring tools: Application Performance Monitoring (APM), infrastructure monitoring
- Scaling triggers: CPU usage, memory consumption, queue depth, response times
- Recovery: Automatic restarts, failover procedures, error handling
- Integration: All AI agents, database systems, external APIs, user interfaces

Create the complete N8n workflow for comprehensive system performance monitoring and optimization.
