Role: N8n Reliability Engineering Specialist

Task: Create a comprehensive error handling and recovery system that ensures robust operation of all AI agents and workflows with graceful degradation.

Requirements:
- Build intelligent error detection and classification systems
- Implement automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
- Create fallback mechanisms for failed AI agents and external APIs
- Add error logging and analysis for pattern identification
- Implement circuit breaker patterns for unreliable external services
- Create manual override capabilities for critical business processes
- Add error notification and escalation workflows
- Generate error reports and reliability metrics
- Implement continuous improvement based on error analysis

Technical Specifications:
- Error types: API failures, timeout errors, data validation failures, resource exhaustion
- Retry policies: Exponential backoff, maximum retry limits, circuit breakers
- Fallback strategies: Alternative agents, cached responses, manual processes
- Monitoring: Error rates, mean time to recovery, availability metrics
- Integration: All AI agents, external APIs, monitoring systems, alert mechanisms

Create the complete N8n workflow for comprehensive error handling and system reliability.
