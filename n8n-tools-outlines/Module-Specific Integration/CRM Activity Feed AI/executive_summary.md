## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Database Setup (5 minutes)
```bash
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy/paste SQL from "Supabase Database Schema" artifact
3. Execute query
4. Verify 6 tables created
```

### Step 2: Configure N8n Credentials (10 minutes)
```bash
1. N8n → Settings → Credentials
2. Add Supabase (service_role key)
3. Add PostgreSQL (direct connection)
4. Add Google Gemini API key
5. Add Email SMTP (optional)
```

### Step 3: Activate Workflows (5 minutes)
```bash
In this order:

```

### Step 4: Test System (10 minutes)
```bash
# Test activity creation
curl -X POST https://your-n8n.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/activity-stream \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "organization_id": "test-org-id",
    "client_id": "test-client-id",
    "type": "email",
    "channel": "email",
    "direction": "inbound",
    "content": "I want to buy a house in downtown"
  }'

# Verify in database
SELECT * FROM activities ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

### Step 5: Integrate with Frontend (30 minutes)
```typescript
// Add to Next.js app
import { useActivityFeed } from '@/hooks/useActivityFeed';

export default function ClientProfile({ clientId, orgId }) {
  const { feed, loading } = useActivityFeed(clientId, orgId);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Engagement Score: {feed?.client.engagement_score}</h1>
      {feed?.activities.map(activity => (
        <ActivityCard key={activity.id} {...activity} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```
