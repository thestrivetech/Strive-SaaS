## ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Maintenance

### Health Check Queries

```sql
-- System health overview
SELECT * FROM v_system_health;

-- Recent workflow executions
SELECT 
  workflow_name,
  status,
  duration_ms,
  started_at
FROM workflow_executions
WHERE started_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY started_at DESC;

-- Attribution coverage
SELECT 
  DATE(c.timestamp) as date,
  COUNT(DISTINCT c.id) as conversions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT a.conversion_id) as attributed
FROM campaign_conversions c
LEFT JOIN campaign_attribution a ON a.conversion_id = c.id
WHERE c.timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(c.timestamp);
```

### Key Metrics Dashboard

Create a view for real-time monitoring:

```sql
CREATE VIEW v_daily_metrics AS
SELECT 
  DATE(m.date) as date,
  COUNT(DISTINCT m.campaign_id) as active_campaigns,
  SUM(m.spend) as total_spend,
  SUM(m.revenue) as total_revenue,
  AVG(m.roi) as avg_roi,
  SUM(m.conversions) as total_conversions
FROM campaign_metrics m
WHERE m.date > CURRENT_DATE - 30
GROUP BY DATE(m.date)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```
