# Qdrant & RAG & Embedding Model #
We will be implementing the qdrant vector database for embeddings on numerous data points and information for the real estate industry for all of our AI agents and tools to use in order to assist real estate agents who use our SaaS platform. 

# Perplexity API & Research -> Data Retrieval Agent / Data & Information Validator #
Perplexity API key will be used to do a good portion of the research and data gathering. Then we will have AI agents who specialize in certain parts of real estate that will then chunk the information and prep it for all of our databases.

# Datalake #
S3 or MongoDB will be used as our datalake which includes ALL data from past and present -> SupaBase (postgreSQL) & pgvectors will be used for long term vectorization on things that involve older and less relevant data which won't be pulled
