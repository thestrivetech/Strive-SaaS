# Strive Website - Complete Implementation Guide

## Project Overview
This document outlines all necessary updates to transform the Strive website from its current 70% complete state to a professional $10,000 value business platform. Each section includes detailed implementation requirements, acceptance criteria, and technical specifications.

---
# Phase 0 #
- Update Font selection and hieracrchy (refer to chat with Grok & Perplexity)
- Maybe add perplexity AI browser as an API somewhere on the website to display the power of AI search?
- Fix ratios to work correctly for all screen sizes. Example: The demo presentation in the home hero section looks perfect in it's current layout but on other peoples screen it looks way too big.
- Change hero section main gradientt color to white?
- Change icon spacing & make icons bigger on 3rd section on home page
- Flip 3rd and 4th section on home page - The industry specific solutions need to be higher on the page
## Phase 1: Critical Navigation & Brand Implementation

### 1.1 Login Authentication System
**Priority: HIGH**
**Current State**: Login page exists but non-functional - Make sure Supabase connection is functional
**Requirements**:
- Update `/login` and `/signup` functions with proper form validation
- Implement JWT-based authentication system
- Add session management and protected routes
- Create user dashboard/profile page (only available and viewable after sign up)

* !!! - Everything above has been implemented - Just need to double check the "Users need to be approved by admin before account activation" process

- Go into supabase and create a new "admin users" table for specifc admin access to the backend of the site - This will give access to all strive members to publish new case studies, update resource content, and to upload new content to the portfolio
- Make two classes of users: "Client & Admin" - Need to make it to where new clients have to be approved for account creation when they sign up - Admin has to approve their sign up request via the "Admin Dashboard" which hasn't been created yet but will be accessible via a admin account on the backend of the website once the admin has logged in
- Create test login credentials to test this functionality and to start designing the logged in user and employee experience
- Add logout functionality to navigation once client is logged in
- Store user state globally (Supabase Users Table which has already been created on the Supabase website)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Users can register new accounts
- Users can login with email/password
- Login button shows "Dashboard" when authenticated
- Protected routes redirect to login when not authenticated

### 1.2 Logo Implementation
**Priority: HIGH**
**Current State**: Navigation uses correct logo asset
**Requirements**:
- Ensure logo is properly sized and positioned
- Add hover effects and smooth transitions
- Optimize logo loading performance
